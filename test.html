<p> <b>Chairman’s Statement</b> </p>
<p> A year has now passed since I became Chairman of Stolt-Nielsen Limited, and I must say that it has   been both an eventful and, in many respects, a successful year for the Company – all things considered. </p>
<p> From a global economic perspective, perhaps the most noteworthy feature of 2010 was not what   happened, but what   did not   happen. In the U.S. and Europe, the much-discussed double-dip recession   did not materialise – at least not yet – thanks largely to the strength and vitality of the world’s   emerging economies. So 2010 was not too bad after all – a year of modest economic growth and,   I hope, a transition to better times ahead. </p>
<p> Last year was also a good year for SNL. As expected, the parcel tanker market continued to slide   sideways in 2010, driven by downward pressure on freight rates due to excess tonnage. Stolt Tankers   nevertheless managed an operating profit in what one industry analyst described as “one of the most   challenging years in modern times” for chemical tanker operators. In addition, we secured a full refund   of $340 million for the newbuilding contracts that we cancelled with SLS Shipbuilding. The refund was   timely. We were able to quickly redeploy those resources to acquire seven high quality ships in the   second-hand market. As a result, we were able to start the New Year having met our near-term tonnage   needs on quite favourable terms. </p>
<p> The performances of Stolt Tank Containers and Stolthaven Terminals perhaps better reflected the   firming of economic conditions in 2010. These two businesses generated 75% of SNL’s total operating   profit in 2010, and the growth prospects for both continue to look attractive. </p>
<p> As “growing in challenging times” is the theme of this annual report, I should point out that the Board   of Directors, working closely with management, took significant steps to support the continued growth   of SNL’s businesses. During 2010, the Board approved investments totalling approximately three-  quarters of a billion dollars, distributed across the full spectrum of our businesses. This, I might add,   during a year in which many shipping companies merely tread water, if not struggled for survival. </p>
<p> In closing, while I will refrain from any attempt at economic forecasting, I will say this: The Board of   Directors of Stolt-Nielsen Limited is committed to delivering increased shareholder value by supporting   the continued growth of the Company, as conditions permit and as prudence dictates. </p>

<p> <b>Chief Executive Officer’s Review</b> </p>
<p> Despite weak global economic conditions overall and challenging financial markets, 2010 turned out   to be a relatively good year for Stolt-Nielsen Limited. Our conservative approach to managing our   businesses and our finances, combined with the favourable effects of actions taken in recent years,   continued to serve us well. For the full year ended November 30, 2010, we reported a net profit of   $106.1 million, up from $95.5 million a year ago. </p>
<p> Among 2010’s most significant highlights, several stand out. The first was Stolt Tankers’ quite   respectable performance last year, when viewed in the context of overall market conditions and   compared with the results of our competitors. Our decision in 2008 to go long on contracts and short   on tonnage was a key factor in our performance. We were also pleased with the agreements that we   reached last year on our contracts with SLS Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. of South Korea. As a result of those   agreements, we were able to secure four new tankers at significantly reduced prices, while cancelling   and obtaining a full refund of $295.8 million, plus interest, for progress payments made on eight ships   that had been ordered in 2006 and 2007. To help make up for the tonnage lost on the eight cancelled   ships, we entered an agreement to time charter six large, sophisticated stainless steel chemical tankers   from JO Tankers for three years. Finally, we announced in November plans to acquire seven stainless   steel parcel tankers in a series of separate transactions for a total consideration of $255.0 million –   terms we considered quite favourable. Ships of such quality and sophistication, I should note, are   rarely available on the second-hand market. As a result of these actions, Stolt Tankers is now well   positioned to meet its anticipated tonnage requirements for the next several years – a goal that was   achieved both cost effectively and without adding a single new ship to the market. </p>
<p> The year also was highlighted by our results at Stolt Tank Containers and Stolthaven Terminals, which   generated a combined operating profit of well over $100 million. The growth we have achieved in these   businesses over the years gives us two other strong legs on which to stand, to mitigate the effects of   periodic cyclical downturns in the parcel tanker business. </p>
<p> We were also pleased with the creation of the joint venture between Sungas Holdings Ltd. and   Stolt-Nielsen Gas (SNG). With the pooling of our assets in Avance Gas Holding Ltd., we have achieved  </p>
<p> <b>“ </b>  <b>Our conservative </b>  <b>approach to managing </b>  <b>our businesses and our </b>  <b>finances, combined with </b>  <b>the favourable effects </b>  <b>of actions taken in </b>  <b>recent years, continued </b>  <b>to serve us well.”</b> </p>
<p> <b>Niels G. Stolt-Nielsen</b>  Chief Executive Officer </p>
<p> another step toward the consolidation of the highly fragmented LPG shipping segment – our stated   objective since we formed SNG in 2007.  </p>
<p> Stolt Sea Farm delivered another year of solid earnings, despite the recession in Spain, its largest   market for turbot.  </p>
<p><h2> Stolt Tankers </h2>
 Stolt Tankers’ operating profit increased to $31.4 million in 2010, up from $24.8 million in 2009. The   average of the Stolt Tankers Joint Service Sailed-In Time Charter Index rose to 1.17 from 1.10 in 2009. </p>
<p> Conditions in the parcel tanker market remained depressed in 2010, as expected, with a significant   decrease in spot rates due largely to an oversupply of tonnage. Contract rate renewals in 2010 were   lower on average by about 1%. Volumes from our contracts improved during the year, resulting   in a relatively stable revenue base compared with the far more volatile spot market. In general for   shipowners in the parcel tanker trade, the weakness in market conditions accelerated ship recycling   schedules and when possible newbuilding orders were cancelled or delayed. In some cases owners   walked away from contracts because of an inability to obtain financing. Even though volumes   generated from our contracts are getting close to pre-crisis 2008 levels, the challenge we and the rest   of our segment have is the overcapacity in supply generated by newbuildings delivered from 2008 until   today. Even though most of the tonnage delivered during this period was relatively simple and smaller   units, and therefore not suitable for the contract market we serve, there will be continued pressure   on our segment as a result of this oversupply. Nevertheless, the market will ultimately turn and our   objective is to position Stolt Tankers as best we can to make the most of the turn when it occurs. </p>
<p><h2> Stolthaven Terminals </h2>
 Stolthaven Terminals reported an operating profit of $56.9 million in 2010, up from $50.0 million in   2009. Results for the year reflected sustained strength in demand for storage, utilisation and volumes   of product handled, combined with a year-over-year increase in global network capacity of 66,094 cbm,   an increase of 2.4%. Among our wholly owned terminals, our U.S. facilities in Houston and New Orleans   both performed well, as did our terminal in Santos, Brazil, which operated at 100% utilisation for most   of the year. In China, both of our terminals are now licensed to store bonded products and we saw a   significant increase in utilisation as a result. Stolthaven Westport reported record utilisation through   the year, and our joint-venture terminals in Antwerp, Belgium and Ulsan, South Korea both posted   record profits. </p>
<p> In 2010, we continued to focus on the expansion of Stolthaven’s global network. During the year the   Board of Directors approved plans to add a further 1,025,900 cbm of new capacity, for the next coming   years, bringing our total capacity when completed to 3,959,000 cbm, or a 42% increase in our   worldwide capacity compared with year-end 2009. We are also adding a number of new jetties and   berths to better accommodate the ships calling at our terminals. In Singapore, construction of our   new terminal on Jurong Island is now under way. The terminal is expected to open in late 2011, with   an initial planned capacity of 73,000 cbm, including gas spheres. We are grateful to the Economic   Development Board of Singapore for its energetic support of this project. </p>
<p> During 2010 we tried on several occasions to acquire existing terminals, but due to strong competition   did not succeed. Even though we have the investment capacity, we felt prices were too high. Our   project team is continuing to evaluate terminal opportunities in both emerging and developed markets,   but with some caution due to the quite aggressive expansions that have been announced by operators   in major ports.  </p>
<p><h2> Stolt Tank Containers </h2>
 Stolt Tank Containers (STC) reported a record operating profit of $64.3 million in 2010, up from   $54.2 million in 2009. Results for the year reflected an increase in shipments of nearly 15%.    STC’s tank container and flexitank operations benefited from higher volumes in both the chemical   and food-grade sectors. </p>
<p> Effective fleet management played an important role in STC’s performance in 2010. STC maintained   a balanced fleet among the regions, with tanks in the right places at the right times, without   increasing the number of empty repositioning of tanks. The 15% increase in shipments in 2010 was   due to healthy demand, but also because of a larger fleet as a result of the Taby acquisition, which we   completed in 2008, though the effect of the added tanks was obscured in 2009 due to the impact from   the financial crisis. </p>

<p> <b>Experienced, talented people</b> </p>
<p> SNL’s employees are recognised worldwide for   their knowledge, experience and dedication.   Our emphasis on training and career development   benefits our customers, our shareholders and   our employees themselves. </p>
<p> <b>Strong market leadership positions</b> </p>
<p> SNL’s operating units are recognised leaders in the   markets they serve. The Stolt name is synonymous   with quality, reliability, service and safety among   our customers and suppliers. </p>
<p> We believe that the growth prospects for Stolt Tank Containers are promising and we are investing   accordingly. During 2010, STC took delivery of 900 units, with a second order of 1,100 units now being   delivered. In addition, in late 2010, STC placed an order for 4,850 tanks, to be delivered between   March of 2011 and the spring of 2012. The new tanks will support the growth of both our chemical   and food-grade fleets. We are also focused on the expansion of our flexitank operations. A new   manufacturing partnership reached in 2010 is allowing STC to control the quality and performance   of its flexitanks, a growing mode of door-to-door transportation. The expansion of STC’s global   network of depots continues with two new depots in 2010 and more to come in 2011. </p>
<p><h2> Stolt Sea Farm </h2>
 Stolt Sea Farm (SSF) reported an operating profit of $12.6 million in 2010, up from $4.5 million in 2009.   Results for the year reflected swings in demand and prices, driven by fluctuations in consumer sentiment   and reduced supplies of turbot from competitors. During the holiday sales period at the start of the year,   turbot prices fell to their lowest levels in more than a decade, as consumer spending retreated in the   face of weak economic conditions. The impact was particularly severe in Spain, SSF’s largest market   for turbot. As the year unfolded, however, consumer demand began to firm, just as production from   competing turbot producers declined – both to SSF’s benefit. Turbot prices reached a peak in late   summer, rising by more than 50% from the lows recorded in December. Caviar sales were also up for   the year, though prices and volumes were largely in line with expectations and seasonal patterns. </p>
<p> SSF addressed the weak conditions early in the year by focusing on actions to improve operational   efficiency and reduce costs. Recognising the weakness in Spain, SSF also worked to strengthen its   sales efforts in the healthier economies of the UK, France, Italy, Germany and Scandinavia. </p>
<p> SSF remains focused on growing its operations. The company’s sole farm in Anglet, France has been   a success and has now reached its production target of 350 tonnes a year. We now have the knowledge   to move to the next stage of our development of sole production. In 2011, SSF believes it will be able   to secure land for the building of an industrial-sized sole farm that will increase production of sole to   the same level as that of our turbot operations. </p>
<p><h2> Stolt-Nielsen Gas </h2>
 Stolt-Nielsen Gas (SNG) reported loss of $6.7 million in 2010, compared with a loss of $1.2 million   in 2009, reflecting a challenging market caused by new tonnage coming into the market ahead of the   new supply of gas expected from the Middle East. Our strategy remains the same, which is to acquire   second-hand tonnage and consolidate by mergers of smaller operators in preparation for the expected   increase in gas production. Just after the end of the 2010 fiscal year, we announced that Stolt-Nielsen Gas   and Sungas Holdings Ltd had become equal shareholders in Avance Gas Holding Ltd. (Avance Gas).  </p>

<p> <b>Diversified business model</b> </p>
<p> SNL’s diversified business model mitigates the   effects of down cycles that periodically impact the   global transportation markets that the Company   serves. The value of SNL’s diversification efforts   was underscored by Stolthaven Terminals’ and   Stolt Tank Containers’ record performance in 2010. </p>
<p> <b>Conservative approach to financing</b> </p>
<p> SNL’s ongoing commitment to managing its   businesses conservatively and maintaining a   strong balance sheet enabled the Company to   continue to invest in the diversification and   growth of its businesses in 2010. </p>
<p> As part of this transaction, Sungas sold three very large gas carriers (VLGCs) to Avance Gas. Including   the former Sungas ships, Avance Gas now owns four VLGCs, operates a fifth VLGC under a time charter,   and time charters a medium-sized gas carrier. </p>
<p><h2> Stolt Bitumen Services </h2>
 Stolt Bitumen Services (SBS) continued to focus on the development of a bitumen distribution network   in Asia Pacific that will ultimately include terminals, bitumen tankers and bitutainers. SBS currently   operates a fleet of over 100 bitutainers, serving the needs of customers in South East Asia, Australia   and New Zealand. SBS took delivery of its first newbuilding – a 5,900 dwt bitumen tanker – in October   2010, which is now on long-term time charter to a leading energy company. Just prior to that, SBS   signed an agreement with Nanjing East Star Shipbuilding Co. Ltd in China for the purchase of up to   four 3,500 dwt bitumen tanker newbuildings, due for delivery from March 2012. </p>
<p><h2> Dividend and Employee Incentive Plans </h2>
 On December 16, 2010, SNL paid an interim dividend of $0.50 per Common Share to shareholders   on record as of December 2, 2010. </p>
<p> For 2010, the employee performance incentive plans for SNL and SSF, which includes the profit sharing   plan and long-term incentive plan, will make payments of $14.3 million. </p>
<p> Significant uncertainty remains in the global economy, however there are some positive signs.   The slowdown in the U.S. and Europe has not had the same historical impact on the global economy,   as Asia, India and South America continue to grow and become large enough to pick up the slack   in consumption in the West. We intend to proceed prudently ahead, investing appropriately and   strengthening our businesses to ensure superior competitive performance come what may. </p>
<p> As always, the performance of our businesses is driven by our employees, who did an outstanding    job in 2010. </p>

<p> <b>Hans Feringa</b>  President of Stolt Tankers </p>
<p> Stolt Tankers (ST) operates the world’s largest integrated marine transportation network for chemicals   and other bulk liquids. With a global fleet of more than 60 sophisticated deep-sea parcel tankers   – complemented by regional fleets in Europe, Asia and the Caribbean, coastal fleets in Asia and inland   barging services in Europe and the U.S. Gulf – ST safely and reliably meets the exacting transportation   needs of the world’s premier manufacturers of chemicals and other bulk liquids. </p>
<p> 2010 was one of the most challenging years on record for the chemical transportation markets. Spot   rates slipped below operating expenses at times during the year, reflecting both an oversupply of   tonnage and still-sluggish economic conditions. Stolt Tankers, with its strategic focus on long-term   contracts, managed a break-even performance that compared favourably with the results reported by   most of its competitors. </p>
<p><h2> Highlights for 2010 </h2>
 Despite the difficult business conditions, 2010 was a year of significant progress for Stolt Tankers,   in terms of information technology (IT) initiatives, safety and fleet replenishment. </p>
<p> On the IT side, ST is now implementing both its new IMOS6 and BASSnet systems. IMOS (Integrated   Maritime Operations System) provides a single window to the entire voyage management process,   by integrating information on chartering, operations, financials, planning, trading, demurrage and   pooling. In doing so, ST will benefit from better ship scheduling and matching, plus an improved   contract-to-orders-to-invoicing process, that will increase efficiency and improve decision-making.   ST’s new BASSnet system focuses on shipowning. The system provides a master database for all aspects   of fleet management for improved decision support and control. </p>
<p> In 2006, Stolt Tankers launched the “Excellence in Safety” programme, which established safety –   for both people and the environment – as ST’s number-one priority. Building on the experience and   knowledge gained over the last four years, 2010 witnessed the launching of “Excellence in Safety   Part 2”, which introduced enhanced programmes targeting procedures and situational awareness.   With the implementation of the programme, Stolt Tankers has set a goal of zero incidents for the fleet. </p>
<p> Even the worst of years have something to recommend them, and so it was for Stolt Tankers in   2010, as prices for sophisticated second-hand tonnage dropped to their lowest levels in a decade.   Stolt Tankers agreed to acquire seven stainless-steel parcel tankers ranging from 23,000 dwt   to 37,000 dwt for $255.0 million. The acquisitions were made after having secured a refund of    $295.8 million plus interest for progress payments that had been made on eight newbuildings that   were cancelled last year. Stolt Tankers also negotiated more favourable prices for four 44,000 dwt   coated newbuildings. In addition, ST took six large stainless steel parcel tankers on a three-year time   charter from JO Tankers. The net effect of these actions enabled Stolt Tankers to meet its expected   near-term requirements for tonnage. </p>
<p><h2> Strategy </h2>
 Stolt Tankers’ focus on long-term contracts over the last several years has generated benefits for   both ST and its customers. By focusing on contract business, ST avoided exposure to plunging freight   rates in the spot market. At the same time, long-term customer relationships enable partners to work   together collaboratively toward mutual goals, particularly on such key issues as safety, quality and   reliability. Despite the challenges of recent years – and perhaps, in part, because of them – Stolt Tankers’   relationships with its customers have never been closer. </p>
<p><h2> Outlook </h2>
 2011 is expected to be a transition year for Stolt Tankers and the markets it serves. While business and   economic conditions overall are expected to improve, the upturn is expected to be modest. As a result,   the focus for Stolt Tankers will be on effectively managing through the transition in 2011 in order to   best position the business for the turnaround that is likely to materialise in 2012.  </p>

<p> <b>Strategy</b>  Continue to enhance our global terminal network by   expanding our existing terminals and developing new   terminals in key growth markets. </p>
<p> <b>Outlook</b>  2011 is expected to be another solid year, with sustained   strength in demand for storage and rates holding steady   or increasing modestly. </p>
<p> <b>Walter Wattenbergh </b>  President of Stolthaven Terminals </p>
<p> Stolthaven Terminals operates a global network of eight state-of-the-art bulk liquid storage terminals   in key markets worldwide, with a ninth terminal currently under construction in Singapore. Each   terminal is managed to the same rigorous standards, ensuring consistent high levels of quality,   efficiency and safety for both people and the environment. Stolthaven’s ongoing efforts to improve   efficiency at the ship-terminal interface have measurably reduced both ship turnaround times and   demurrage, resulting in mutual benefits for Stolthaven and its customers. </p>
<p> Stolthaven achieved solid overall results in 2010, reflecting the impact of capacity expansions,   increased demand for storage and strengthening rates. Stolthaven’s wholly owned terminal in Santos   and its joint-venture facilities in Antwerp and Ulsan benefited from strong market conditions and   rising rates, while the division’s wholly owned terminals in the U.S. have recovered more slowly. After   becoming operational in 2009, the division’s new terminal in Lingang posted a modest profit in 2010   and approval was received for an additional 104,500 cbm of capacity. At Ningbo, the first phase of   tank construction was completed early in the year. Combined total storage capacity for Stolthaven’s   wholly owned and joint venture terminals increased to 2.9 million cbm from 2.8 million cbm at   year-end 2009. For Stolthaven’s wholly owned terminals, while utilisation slipped to 95.4% from 97.0%   in 2009, total average capacity increased by 11% in 2010, driven by expansions in New Orleans and   Santos. Total product handled rose by 14%, due to growing momentum in customer activity in the U.S. </p>
<p><h2> Highlights for 2010 </h2>
 After adding 830,000 cbm of total network capacity in 2009 – an increase of 42% – Stolthaven added   66,000 cbm in 2010, while focusing on its long-term growth strategy and implementing plans for   substantial capacity expansions in 2011 and beyond. Among the division’s wholly owned terminals,   plans were approved for the addition of 103,000 cbm of capacity at Stolthaven Houston, and the   addition of several new tanks at Stolthaven Santos.  </p>
<p> Ambitious expansion plans were also set for several of our joint venture terminals. A total of 1,096,000 cbm   of additional capacity was approved in 2010. Early in the third quarter, Stolthaven broke ground for   its new chemical storage facility on Jurong Island, Singapore. The terminal is expected to come online   by year-end 2011, with an initial capacity of 73,000 cbm. The year was also highlighted by the   performance of the Santos Terminal, which received for the fifth year in a row Dow Brazil’s DOWGol   award that “celebrates the commitment of all suppliers to meet the stringent safety requirements   established by Dow.” </p>
<p><h2> Strategy </h2>
 Stolthaven remains focused on the long-term growth of its global terminal business by expanding its   existing owned terminals, by developing new terminals in hubs frequented by the Stolt Tankers’ fleet,   and by increasing Stolthaven’s penetration of key emerging markets, including Brazil, India and   the Middle East. Efforts are also under way to diversify Stolthaven’s operations by adding storage   capabilities for such products as gas, clean petroleum products and veg oils. </p>
<p><h2> Outlook </h2>
 Looking ahead, Stolthaven expects another good year in 2011. Current indicators point to continued   strength in demand for storage, with rates likely to hold firm or to increase modestly overall. </p>
<p> <b>“ </b>  <b>Stolthaven presented </b>  <b>very good results </b>  <b>in 2010 due to the </b>  <b>impact of capacity </b>  <b>expansions from </b>  <b>previous years and </b>  <b>increased demand for </b>  <b>storage worldwide.”</b> </p>

<p> <b>Mike Kramer</b>  President of Stolt Tank Containers </p>
<p> Stolt Tank Containers (STC) is the leading global provider of door-to-door transportation services for   bulk-liquid chemicals and food-grade products. STC’s fleet of more than 24,000 tank containers – the   world’s largest – includes specialised tank containers for corrosive, high purity and cryogenic cargoes,   as well as compressed gases. The division’s rapidly growing flexitank services offer the cost benefits   of flexitanks, while maintaining STC’s standards for quality, reliability and performance. </p>
<p> STC reported strong growth in its tank container and flexitank businesses in 2010, with increased   volumes and utilisation, in both its chemical and food-grade operations. Competition, however,   remained keen. STC focused on holding down costs and increasing efficiency through its sustained   pursuit of business-process improvements. </p>
<p><h2> Highlights for 2010 </h2>
 STC’s performance during the year was highlighted by a number of important events and developments   making 2010 another record year. </p>
<p> In May, STC announced a complete realignment of its global management structure. The reorganisation   created a tightly knit and coordinated team with the ability to react quickly to market opportunities   and challenges both locally and globally. The cooperative efforts of the new team – assisted by STC’s   advanced fleet-optimisation technology – played a critical role in STC’s ability to maintain a balanced   fleet amid striking shifts in geographic demand during 2010. </p>
<p> Expanding STC’s global presence is an ongoing objective and significant progress was made on this   front in 2010. STC continued its efforts to expand its global depot network, particularly in key growth   and emerging markets, to support the growth in the tank container business, to improve safety and   meet the rising standards of our customers globally. </p>
<p> STC has long emphasised the effective use of information technology to drive improvements in   efficiency and cost control. Those efforts continued unabated in 2010 with the implementation of   new software and management tools aimed at enhancing STC’s performance and competitive advantage. </p>
<p> During the year, STC continued to take steps to enhance its fleet. The division took delivery of 900 new   units, with almost 6,000 more on order. Further significant additions to the fleet are under way. At the   same time, STC off-hired more than 1,000 older higher cost and/or less efficient units, resulting in   reduced fleet expense. </p>
<p> STC’s flexitank operations benefited from a new global supplier partnership with M&W Flexitank,   a Hong Kong-based manufacturer of certified high quality flexitanks. The partnership ensures that   flexitanks operated by STC are manufactured to the high standards for quality and reliability demanded   by STC and its customers. To help address environmental concerns regarding flexitank usage, STC   implemented both a bulkhead and bag recycling programme in 2010. </p>
<p> STC also expanded its food-grade fleet in 2010, while aggressively stepping up marketing efforts   on a worldwide basis. STC’s growing food-grade fleet now includes more than 1,700 units. </p>
<p><h2> Strategy </h2>
 As volumes continue to flow into tank containers and flexitanks from other modes, STC’s growth   strategy is focused on expanding its core chemical tank container business by penetrating new   geographic markets, growing its flexitank and food-grade businesses, and building out STC’s   global network of offices and depots, especially in developing markets, through wholly-owned   or joint-venture facilities. </p>
<p><h2> Outlook </h2>
 While door-to-door markets are likely to be sluggish in the first few months of 2011, activity is   expected to strengthen as the year unfolds. Key drivers include intra-regional growth in Asia Pacific,   and increasing momentum in the Middle East, as more downstream production comes online,   particularly in Saudi Arabia. Good growth is also expected in South America, with market activity   in Europe and North America either remaining firm or growing. </p>

<p> <b>Strategy</b>  Drive long-term growth by expanding our sole and    caviar operations. </p>
<p> <b>Outlook</b>  Conservatively manage the business and hold down costs,   given the uncertain conditions in SSF’s key European markets   for turbot. </p>
<p> <b>Pablo García</b>  President of Stolt Sea Farm </p>
<p> Stolt Sea Farm (SSF) is a leader in high-tech aquaculture and specialises in the production of turbot,   sole, sturgeon and caviar. SSF focuses on premium species whose cultivation requires extensive   scientific and technological expertise, ongoing research and development, and the engineering   capability to design, build and operate unique and highly sophisticated production facilities. SSF,   with its strictly land-based approach to fish farming, is recognised for its outstanding environmental   friendliness and performance. </p>
<p> After a dismal start, with turbot prices down to levels not seen in more than a decade, 2010 proved   to be a relatively good year for Stolt Sea Farm. Prices strengthened as demand began to recover in   Spain – SSF’s largest turbot market. At the same time, SSF took steps to reduce its dependency on   Spain by expanding its marketing efforts in other European countries. Rising levels of demand were   complemented by falling levels of turbot supplies, as production from other turbot suppliers weakened.   For the full year, revenue from sales of turbot was up about 15%. Meanwhile the revenue from sales of   caviar was essentially flat for the full year, in line with overall expectations for sales of luxury goods. </p>
<p><h2> Highlights </h2>
 Expectations for 2010 were not high and the strength of SSF’s performance last year was a welcome   surprise. The year was also highlighted by results at SSF’s sole farm in Anglet, France, which met its   initial production target of 200 tonnes. The Anglet farm is now operating at its planned commercial   production capacity of 350 metric tonnes a year.  </p>
<p> During the year, SSF participated in a number of events that resulted in a significant increase in   market visibility for the division’s products. SSF’s Prodemar turbot was selected as the key ingredient   for the finale of the Trophée Passion competition, held in October by the Academie Culinaire de France   in Paris. In January, SSF introduced its Prodemar sole at the Madrid Fusión Summit, the ninth edition   of this international gathering focusing on gastronomy. SSF’s sole is now being marketed in Europe,   Russia and the U.S. Such exposure raises awareness among chefs and restaurateurs regarding the high   quality of the Prodemar brands. </p>
<p><h2> Strategy </h2>
 SSF’s long-term growth strategy focuses on the expansion of its sole and caviar operations.    The viability of SSF’s sole farm in Anglet has enabled SSF to move forward last year with plans   for additional production capacity. SSF is currently the world’s only aquaculture company with   the capability to farm sole. SSF is also actively pursuing an expansion of its sturgeon and caviar   production. These initiatives are aimed at establishing SSF as the leader in sole and caviar, premium   products that will not only fuel SSF’s future growth but reduce SSF’s exposure to the cyclicality of the   more competitive turbot market. </p>
<p><h2> Outlook </h2>
 Economic conditions in SSF’s key markets for turbot in Europe remain both mixed and uncertain. Given   the fragility of consumer sentiment, SSF is taking a conservative, patient approach to the year ahead,   with continued emphasis on holding down costs, until key indicators point to greater strength in both   consumer confidence and overall economic conditions. </p>

<p> Stolt-Nielsen Gas (SNG) through its 50% owned subsidiary Avance Gas Holding Ltd. (Avance Gas) is   a newly established player in the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) transportation market, operating five   Very Large Gas Carriers (VLGC) and one Medium Gas Carrier (MGC).  </p>
<p><h2> Highlights </h2>
 2010 was a year of substantial progress in the implementation of its strategy to participate in the   consolidation of the highly fragmented LPG transportation market. In January 2010, after having   taken the   Yuhsho   on a three-year time charter in November 2009, Avance Gas purchased the   Stolt   Avance  , a 2003 built, 82,500 cubic meter VLGC. Then in December 2010, after the end of the fiscal   year, SNG merged its VLGC operations with that of Sungas Holdings Ltd. (Sungas) with both parties   becoming equal owners of Avance Gas. As part of the transaction Sungas added three VLGCs to the   Avance Gas fleet:   Iris Glory  ,   Thetis Glory   and   Venus Glory  , all built in 2008 with a cargo capacity of   83,700 cbm each.  </p>
<p> With the addition of the three Sungas ships, the Avance Gas fleet now consists of six ships. In   addition to the three Glory ships and   Stolt Avance  , Avance Gas operates the   Yuhsho  , built in 1999   with a capacity of 78,500 cbm, and the   Navigator Taurus  , built in 2009 with a capacity of 22,600 cbm,   which was taken on time charter in October 2010 for the West African trade. Avance Gas trades its   fleet primarily in the spot market, with four of its five VLGC loading in Middle East for destinations   mainly in Asia. </p>
<p> The spot market began the year at a historic low, and although the rates improved during the year,   the market remained challenging throughout most of the year. Late spring last year, volumes started   to improve as new LNG production trains came onstream, adding welcome volume to the market.   Although freight rates fell somewhat back during the summer, the second part of the year also gave   encouraging returns backed by increased production and export in the Middle East.  </p>
<p><h2> Outlook </h2>
 The outlook for 2011 is promising with expected increased export volumes from the Middle East.   The order book for VLGC is limited with about 10 ships on order out of an existing fleet of 143 ships.   However, the market is still oversupplied and the market balance remains fragile.  </p>
<p> As a consequence of the merger with Sungas, Avance Gas was reported as a discontinued operation   in 2009 and 2010. Henceforth, results from the partnership will be recorded as equity income for   Stolt-Nielsen Limited. </p>

<p> Stolt Bitumen Services (SBS) made continued progress last year toward its long-term goal of building   a high quality, safe and reliable bitumen distribution network, equipped with modern bitumen tankers,   bitutainers and storage terminals. Founded in 2007, SBS is currently focused on the development   of Stolt-branded storage and distribution capabilities for bitumen in the growing Asia Pacific market,   where extensive infrastructure investment is creating strong demand for bitumen across the region.   The shipment of bitumen is complicated by the high temperatures required to maintain the product   in liquid form to allow for pumping. The market for the storage and distribution of bitumen is   highly fragmented. </p>
<p><h2> Highlights </h2>
 In October, SBS took delivery of its first newbuilding,   Stolt Fuji  , a 5,900 dwt bitumen tanker. The   new ship was in turn delivered to a multinational energy company under a long-term time charter   arrangement. In September, SBS signed an agreement with Nanjing East Star Shipbuilding in China for   the purchase of up to four 3,500 dwt bitumen tanker newbuildings, due for delivery from March 2012.   SBS placed firm orders for two ships and holds options to purchase two additional ships. </p>
<p> SBS also operates a fleet of more than 100 bitutainers that are ISO certified for sea, road and rail   transportation. The fleet includes units ranging in size from 21,000 litres – which are ideal for small   ports and rail transportation – up to units with a capacity of 27,000 litres. </p>
<p> Working with joint-venture partners, SBS is currently developing bitumen terminal projects in Vietnam   and Indonesia, as well as a seaborne bulk bitumen distribution network in the Philippines. </p>

<p> <b>Meeting the challenges of  </b>  <b>sustainability at Stolt Tankers</b> </p>
<p> The Chamber of Shipping of America (CSA)   presented the Environmental Achievement   Award to 41 Stolt ships, in recognition of   their outstanding environmental performance   for at least the last two years.   Stolt Vinland     was singled out for achieving 15 consecutive   years of environmental excellence, with   Stolt Kittiwake   and   Stolt Sea   each attaining   10 years of sustained performance. </p>
<p> For Stolt-Nielsen Limited and its operating units, ensuring the safety of people and the environment   is our first priority. We strive to achieve this objective by meeting or exceeding all applicable   requirements and regulations. In addition, we are dedicated to a process of continuous improvement   that is aimed at constantly enhancing our safety performance on a sustained basis in the future. </p>
<p> In 2010, Stolt Tankers achieved ISO14001 certification, which provides a framework for driving   continual improvements in environmental performance. The International Organization for   Standardization defines ISO14001 as an “environmental management system” designed “to reduce   the environmental footprint of a business and to decrease the pollution and waste a business   produces.” ISO14001 helps “an organization to develop an environmental policy, establish objectives   and processes to achieve the policy commitments, take action as needed to improve its performance,   and demonstrate conformity of the system to the requirements” set forth by the standard. ISO14001   certification gives customers added confidence that the company is not only handling all of its waste   streams appropriately, but also constantly striving to do better. </p>
<p> Four years ago, with the launching of its Excellence in Safety programme, Stolt Tankers made safety   its number-one priority. Based on the experience accumulated through that programme, and the latest   industry research, Stolt Tankers rolled out Excellence in Safety Part 2 in 2010. The programme puts   increased emphasis on procedures and situational awareness, which have been identified as key   issues by root-cause analysis. Sophisticated parcel tankers are among the world’s most challenging   ships to operate, given the complexity of the ships and the sheer number of operations performed.   A comparison of performance data shows Stolt Tankers compares favourably with its peers. Excellence   in Safety Part 2 will help Stolt Tankers take its safety performance to an even higher level. </p>
<p> While performance is in many ways its own reward, in May of 2010 the Chamber of Shipping of   America presented its 2009 Environmental Achievement Award to 41 Stolt ships, for their outstanding   environmental performance for at least the last two years.   Stolt Vinland   was singled out for achieving   15 consecutive years of environmental excellence, with   Stolt Kittiwake   and   Stolt Sea   each attaining   10 years of sustained performance. </p>
<p> Stolthaven takes pride in operating a global network of terminals that operates to the same high   standards of safety, quality and efficiency, regardless of location. In 2010, Stolthaven made substantial   progress toward that objective at its two joint-venture terminals in China. The Lingang and Ningbo   terminals both implemented the Stolthaven Terminals Integrated Management System (STIMS), which   is designed to operate in compliance with ISO14001, the ISO9001 quality management system, and the   OHSAS18001 standard for health and safety risk management. Certification is expected in early 2011.   At the New Orleans terminal, a new Behaviour-Based Safety programme was implemented for testing.  </p>
<p> <b> </b>  <b>15</b>  <b> years</b> </p>
<p> <b>Environmental excellence achieved </b>  <b>by </b>  <b>Stolt Vinland</b> </p>
<p> As with tankers, research has shown that terminal incidents can most often be traced to lapses in   awareness and/or adherence to procedures. Following tests in New Orleans, the programme is expected   to be implemented throughout the Stolthaven network. At Oiltanking Stolthaven Antwerp, surveys   are being conducted to evaluate the potential effects of job stress and its impact on safety and   operational performance. </p>
<p> As a pioneer of door-to-door bulk-liquid logistics, Stolt Tank Containers proved that modern tank   containers are among the safest, most reliable ways to transport bulk liquids. To ensure its operations   consistently perform to the industry’s most rigorous standards, STC’s Security, Safety, Health,   Environment & Quality Management System complies with the requirements of ISO9001:2000, ISO22000   (HACCP), ISO28000, ISO19011, OHSAS18001, CDI-mpc and SQAS-Transport services. Developments are   also monitored at other organisations, such as ITCO, CEFIC, ECTA, IRU, EFTCO, IMO and USDOT, and   incorporated into STC’s best practices as applicable. In 2010, STC formed a new global supplier   partnership with M&W Flexitank, a manufacturer of certified high quality flexitanks, with the goal   of setting a new standard for flexitank reliability and quality. STC also implemented both a bulkhead   and bag recycling programme in 2010, to address environmental concerns shared by STC and its global   customers regarding flexitank usage. As it expands its global network, STC equips its new depots with   state-of-the-art waste-management systems, while continually upgrading the capabilities of its existing   depots beyond current regulatory standards. </p>
<p> The unique methods and technologies applied by Stolt Sea Farm in its land-based fish-farming   operations result in high levels of efficiency and low environmental impact. SSF is now capable of   producing 1 kg of turbot with only 1.1 kg of dry feed. For sole, the amount is even lower at 0.8 kg.   Such levels of efficiency result in negligible levels of organic waste. In fact, the organic material that   SSF’s farms provide to local farmers for fertilizer now consists exclusively of the organic filtrate, such   as seaweed, that is removed from sea water upon intake before it is used by the farm. Efforts to reduce   SSF’s environmental impact are ongoing. At SSF’s sole farm in Anglet, France – the proving ground   for commercial sole production – new high efficiency water recirculation systems have substantially   reduced the farm’s consumption of both energy and water. Through its constant pursuit of such   innovations, SSF continually raises the operational and environmental performance standards   of its state-of-the-art fish-farming facilities. </p>

<p><h1> Relevant legislation and Codes of Practice for Corporate Governance </h1>
</p>
<p> Stolt-Nielsen Limited (“SNL”) maintains high standards of Corporate Governance. Corporate Governance   addresses the interaction between SNL’s shareholders, the Board of Directors and management. </p>
<p> The Companies Act of 1981 of Bermuda (“Bermuda Companies Act”) governs the incorporation,   organisation and management of SNL. In addition, relevant Bermuda and international law also applies   to the operation of the business of SNL. Norwegian securities law and Oslo Børs Continuing Obligations   apply as a result of SNL being listed on the Oslo Børs. Being incorporated in Bermuda and listed on the   Oslo Børs, SNL is subject to the Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance (the “Norwegian   Code of Practice”). Adherence to the Norwegian Code of Practice is based on a “comply or explain”   principle, whereby companies are expected to either comply with the Norwegian Code of Practice   or explain why they have chosen an alternative approach. </p>
<p> SNL was incorporated on June 11, 2010 with the purpose of merging and amalgamating with    Stolt-Nielsen S.A (SNSA). The merger and amalgamation became effective November 18, 2010.    The Group corporate structure and business operations of SNL is identical to that of SNSA. SNL is,    and SNSA has historically been, under the majority control of Fiducia Ltd, a company that indirectly   represents the Stolt-Nielsen family. As such, the Company’s Corporate Governance reflects this majority   control and therefore will not necessarily comply with all recommendations of the Norwegian Code   of Practice for Corporate Governance. </p>
<p><h2> 1. Implementation and reporting on Corporate Governance </h2>
 SNL has a Code of Business Conduct which applies to all Directors, officers and employees. Any waivers   of the Code of Business Conduct for Directors or executive officers are approved by the Board and shall   be disclosed in the Annual Report. The Company’s overarching business conduct guidelines, including   ethical and social responsibility guidance, are set out in its Code of Business Conduct and where   appropriate, more specific policies have been developed to provide more detailed guidance. </p>
<p><h2> 2. Business </h2>
 In compliance with the Bermuda Companies Act and common practice, SNL’s Memorandum of   Association describes its objects and purposes as “unrestricted”. </p>
<p><h2> 3. Equity and dividends </h2>
 The Board of Directors is of the opinion that the Company currently has sufficient equity to meet its   objectives, strategy and risk profile. The authorised share capital of SNL is 65 million Common Shares   with par value $1.00, and 16.25 million Founder’s Shares, with par value $0.001. As of November 30,   2010, 64,133,796 Common Shares and 16,033,449 Founder’s Shares were issued and 59,659,309   Common Shares and 14,914,828 Founder’s Shares were outstanding. The authorised share capital   of SNL may only be increased, reduced or otherwise altered by resolution of the shareholders.   The Board of Directors is authorised to increase the issued share capital within the limits of the   authorised capital. </p>
<p> The Common Shares available for issuance within the authorised share capital is intended to be   available for the exercise of stock options under the Stolt-Nielsen S.A. (SNSA) 1997 stock option    plan as continued by SNL. SNSA’s stock option plan was approved at the 1997 Annual General Meeting.   The stock option plan was established to create a long-term common interest among the Directors,    the employees, and SNSA’s shareholders. The Compensation Committee oversees SNL’s share option   programme. The last awards under the 1997 stock option plan were made in January 2007. It has been   replaced by a long-term incentive plan which pays cash awards to management for meeting defined   corporate financial objectives related to Return On Capital Employed (“ROCE”) and the ratio of Earnings   Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and Rent (“EBITDAR”)-to-Revenue. </p>
<p> The Board of Directors has established a dividend policy that is available on the SNL website    (www.stolt-nielsen.com). Under Bermuda law, a company’s Board of Directors may not declare   or pay dividends if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the company is, or would after   the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or that the realisable value of its   assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and issued share capital and share   premium accounts. </p>
<p> The Company may purchase its own shares for cancellation or acquire them as treasury shares in   accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act on such terms as the Board of Directors shall think fit.   Historically, the General Meeting of Shareholders of SNSA has authorised the Company, or any  </p>
<p> <b>Corporate Governance</b> </p>
<p> wholly-owned subsidiary, to purchase Common Shares of the Company, from time to time in the open   market, provided: </p>
<p> (i) the maximum price to be paid for such Common Shares shall not be higher than the higher of the   price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the Oslo Børs and   shall be in conformity with applicable standards, if any, concerning such purchases that may be   established by the regulatory regimes in such countries where the Common Shares are listed or   admitted for trading; </p>
<p> (ii) the minimum price to be paid for such Common Shares shall not be less than the par value   (i.e. U.S. $1.00 per share) thereof; and  </p>
<p> (iii)   other conditions for trading shall be in conformity with applicable standards, if any, concerning   such purchases that may be established by the regulatory regimes in such countries where the   Common Shares are listed or admitted for trading, and further provided such purchases are in   conformity with applicable law, such authorisation being granted for purchases completed on   or before the following August 31. </p>
<p> The Board of Directors of SNL has resolved to continue share purchases, if any, on the foregoing terms. </p>
<p><h2> 4. Capital structure, equal treatment of shareholders and transactions with   </h2>
<h2> close associates </h2>
 SNL has two classes of shares, Common Shares and Founder’s Shares. Only the Common Shares will   be listed on Oslo Børs.  </p>
<p> Except for matters where applicable law requires the approval of both classes of shares voting as   separate classes, Common Shares and Founder’s Shares vote as a single class on all matters submitted   to a vote of the shareholders, with each share entitled to one vote. </p>
<p> Under the Bye-laws, holders of Common Shares and Founder’s Shares participate in annual dividends,    if any are declared by the Company, in the following order of priority: (i) $0.005 per share to Founder’s   Shares and Common Shares equally; and (ii) thereafter, all further amounts are payable to Common   Shares only.  </p>
<p> Under the Bye-laws, in the event of a liquidation, all debts and obligations of SNL must first be paid   and thereafter all remaining assets of SNL are paid to the holders of Common Shares and Founder’s   Shares in the following order of priority: (i) Common Shares rateably to the extent of the par value   thereof (i.e. $1.00 per share); (ii) Common Shares and Founder’s Shares participate equally up to    $0.05 per share; and (iii) thereafter, Common Shares are entitled to all remaining assets. </p>
<p> As of November 30, 2010, Fiducia Ltd., a company owned by a trust established for the benefit of   certain members of the Stolt-Nielsen family, together with certain members of the Stolt-Nielsen family,   controlled 59.47% of the outstanding shares of SNL entitled to vote generally on matters brought to   a vote of shareholders of SNL. As a result, the Stolt-Nielsen family currently directly and indirectly   exercises a controlling influence over SNL’s operations and has sufficient voting power to control   the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval including: the composition of SNL’s Board of   Directors, which has the authority to direct SNL’s business and to appoint and remove SNL’s officers;   approving or rejecting a merger, consolidation or other business combination; raising future capital;   and amending the Bye-laws which govern the rights attached to SNL’s Common Shares. This control   may also make it difficult to take control of SNL without the approval of the Stolt-Nielsen family.   Additionally, the interests of the Stolt-Nielsen family may conflict with the interests of SNL’s   other shareholders. </p>
<p> The Board of Directors reviews at least annually the financial and other relationships between Directors   and SNL. SNL conducts an appropriate review of all related-party transactions for potential conflict   of interest situations on an ongoing basis and all such transactions are approved by SNL’s Audit   Committee and shall be disclosed in the Annual Report. </p>
<p> Any transactions SNL carries out in its own shares are carried out either through the Oslo Børs   or at prevailing stock exchange prices if carried out in any other way. Directors and the executive   management must notify the Board of Directors if they have any material direct or indirect interest   in any transaction entered into by SNL. Following such declaration, Directors with such a direct or   indirect interest may participate in voting for such transactions unless disqualified by the chairman    of the relevant board meeting.  </p>
<p> The Board of Directors and the Board Committees may retain independent advisors, as they deem   appropriate and at their discretion. SNL shall be responsible for the expenses of any such advisor. </p>
<p><h2> 5. Freely negotiable Shares </h2>
 Only the Common Shares are listed on the Oslo Børs. Bye-law 74.1 of the Company’s Bye-Laws limits   individual shareholdings of Common Shares to 20%, single U.S. person shareholdings to 9.9% and   shareholders of any single country in aggregate to 49.9%. </p>
<p> While the Board of Directors is authorised to restrict, reduce, or prevent the ownership of shares if it   appears to the Board of Directors that such ownership may threaten SNL with adverse consequences,   including but not limited to adverse tax consequences, hostile takeover attempts or adverse   governmental sanctions, it is the intention for the Board of Directors to assess any takeover offer for   SNL or a substantial portion of SNL’s assets, make a recommendation on any such offer, and call for   a General Meeting of Shareholders to vote on the acceptance or rejection of such an offer. </p>
<p><h2> 6. General Meetings </h2>
 The Board of Directors or the Chairman is responsible for calling both Annual and Special General   Meetings of shareholders. At any general meeting, two or more persons present in person throughout   the meeting and representing in person or by proxy issued voting shares in the Company, shall form   a quorum for the transaction of business, except for those matters under the Bermuda Companies Act   for which a specified super majority vote is required, in which case a quorum representing one-third   of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote is required.  </p>
<p> The Board of Directors is obligated to hold an Annual General Meeting every year at such time and   place as the Board of Directors or Chairman shall designate. </p>
<p> A shareholder or group of shareholders representing at least one-tenth of the outstanding voting   shares may request a Special General Meeting in writing indicating the agenda thereof. The Board   of Directors will be obligated to hold the meeting forthwith. </p>
<p> Notices for both Annual and Special General Meetings shall be sent by mail to all holders entitled   to attend and vote there at no later than 21 days before the date set for the General Meeting. </p>
<p> Notices should provide sufficient information on all matters to be considered at the General Meeting,   voting instructions and opportunity to vote by proxy. Matters at the General Meetings are restricted   to those set forth in the agenda. </p>
<p><h2> 7. Nomination Committee </h2>
 Bermuda law does not require that a nomination committee is established. Members of the Board   of Directors identify and evaluate proposed candidates for nomination to the Board of Directors.   Individuals are selected for nomination to the Board of Directors based on their business or   professional experience, the diversity of their background, and their array of talents and perspectives. </p>
<p><h2> 8. Corporate Assembly and Board of Directors: Composition and Independence </h2>
 The business affairs of SNL are managed under the direction of the SNL Board of Directors. The Board   of Directors may delegate authority to the Chairman, specified committees of the Board of Directors,   or to SNL’s management. SNL does not have a corporate assembly. </p>
<p> As provided in SNL’s Bye-laws, the Board of Directors shall be composed of at least three and not more   than nine Directors. The Board of Directors believes that the optimal size for the Board of Directors   should be six to eight Directors. The Board of Directors’ size is flexible depending on the circumstances   and the qualifications of proposed candidates.  </p>
<p> The composition of the Board of Directors shall ensure that the SNL Board of Directors can attend   to the common interests of all shareholders and meets the Company’s need for expertise, capacity,   diversity and independence. </p>
<p> The Directors are elected at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. Directors shall hold office   for such term as decided by the General Meeting, or in absence of such determination, until the next   Annual General Meeting or until their successors are elected or appointed or their office is otherwise   vacated. Directors may be removed only for cause by the vote at a Special General Meeting held for   that purpose. In the event of a vacancy on the Board of Directors, the remaining members of the   Board  of Directors can fill such vacancy and appoint a member to act until the next General Meeting   of shareholders at which the Directors so elected shall be confirmed.  </p>
<p> <b>Corporate Governance continued</b> </p>
<p> Whereas the Board composition meets the requirements according to the Norwegian Code of Practice for   independence from major shareholders and main business associates, only three of the current seven   SNL Directors, Christer Olsson, Håkan Larsson and Christina De Luca, are considered to be independent   from executive management according to the Norwegian Code of Practice. The composition of the Board   of Directors ensures continuity and experience, and together with the Board Committees is, in the view   of the SNL Board of Directors, suitable to represent interest of the minority shareholders. </p>
<p> The Chairman of the Board of Directors is elected by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.    The CEO is a member of the Board of Directors.  </p>
<p><h2> 9. The work of the Board of Directors </h2>
 <b>Board meetings </b>  The Board of Directors holds at least four regularly scheduled meetings a year. Meeting schedules are   approved by all members of the Board of Directors. SNL does not have a deputy Chairman as this has   not been considered necessary. The Board of Directors may appoint a Board Secretary who does not   need to be a member of the Board of Directors. </p>
<p> Decisions of the Board of Directors shall be taken by a majority of the votes cast by the Directors   present and represented at the meeting provided a quorum is present. A majority of the Directors then   in office shall constitute a quorum. The Board of Directors may also act by unanimous written consent. </p>
<p> <b>Board meetings – executive sessions</b>  Management is available to discuss matters of concern to the Board of Directors and the Board   of Directors has regular access to senior management. The basic duties and responsibilities of the   Directors include attending Board of Directors’ meetings, preparing for meetings by advance review   of any meeting materials and actively participating in the Board of Directors’ discussions. Directors   are also expected to make themselves available outside of the Board of Directors’ meetings for advice   and consultation. </p>
<p> The Board of Directors ensures that SNL has effective internal controls in accordance with the   regulations that apply to its activities, including SNL’s corporate values and ethical guidelines. </p>
<p> <b>Board committees </b>  The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee and a Compensation Committee. The Board   of Directors periodically reviews the size, structure and function of the Board Committees. The Audit   Committee and Compensation Committee have written charters. These charters are reviewed and   reassessed by the Board on an annual basis. </p>
<p> The Audit Committee is composed of at least two members; preferably each of whom is independent   pursuant to all applicable regulatory requirements. The Compensation Committee is composed of at   least two members of whom at least one shall be deemed independent pursuant to all regulatory   requirements applicable to SNL. </p>
<p> Each Committee has a Chair who reports the activities of such Committee at meetings of the full   Board of Directors. </p>
<p><h2> 10. Risk Management and Internal Control </h2>
 The Board of Directors is responsible for SNL’s system of internal control, which covers financial,   operational and compliance controls as well as the risk management processes. SNL’s system of internal   control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives   and provide reasonable assurance that SNL is operating legally, ethically and within approved financial   and operational policies and procedures with sufficient safeguards against material financial statement   misstatements or loss of assets. </p>
<p> The Board of Directors, through the Audit Committee, oversees the monitoring of compliance with   its internal control system, including SNL’s Code of Business Conduct. The Audit Committee meets on   a quarterly basis to review and discuss results of internal audits performed by the Operational Audit   Department. This also includes matters of an ethical nature. All employees, customers, suppliers and   other parties have direct access to the Audit Committee, through the whistleblowing system, to report   any potential illegal or unethical matters. </p>
<p> SNL’s business heads conduct an annual review of SNL’s most significant areas of exposure to risk and   the related internal control system.  </p>
<p><h2> 11. Remuneration of the Board of Directors </h2>
 The Board of Directors, on an annual basis, reviews the Directors’ compensation. The review includes    a comparison of SNL’s Directors’ compensation practices against the practices of comparable U.S.    and European companies. </p>
<p> Members of the Board of Directors and/or companies with which they are associated shall not in   principle take on specific assignments for SNL in addition to their appointment as a member of the   Board of Directors. If they do nonetheless take on such assignments this shall be disclosed to the   full Board of Directors. The remuneration for such additional duties shall be approved by the Board   of Directors. </p>
<p> The remuneration awarded to SNL’s Board of Directors for their service as Directors is disclosed in   aggregate at the Annual General Meetings and in the Annual Report. Any remuneration in addition   to normal Directors’ fees shall be specifically identified.  </p>
<p><h2> 12. Remuneration of the executive management </h2>
 The performance and compensation of the CEO is reviewed periodically by the Compensation Committee   and annually by the Board of Directors in an executive session, and not by the general meeting as   recommended in the Norwegian Code of Practice. Following the latter’s review of performance and   consultation with the Chairman, the Committee will recommend any changes in compensation and/or   benefits for decision by the Board of Directors in executive session. The Compensation Committee   approves the principles for compensation policy in SNL and further approves the individual   remuneration of the members of Executive Management. </p>
<p> The Company has in place a long-term incentive plan aimed at tying the Executive Management’s   compensation with the performance of the Company. This is a cash-based plan which sets future   payouts based on Company performance relative to targets for Return On Capital Employed and   EBITDAR-to-Revenue. All performance-related compensation is capped at a maximum percent of   the salary of the Executive Management. </p>
<p><h2> 13. Information and Communications </h2>
 All information distributed to SNL’s shareholders is published on SNL’s website. </p>
<p> SNL promptly submits all material press releases to Oslo Børs, disseminates such material press    releases through an approved newswire service that provides simultaneous and broad distribution.  </p>
<p> Copies of audited financial statements of SNL are distributed to shareholders prior to the Annual   General Meeting of Shareholders and filed with the Oslo Børs in accordance with its requirements.    SNL publishes an overview each year of the dates for major events such as its Annual General Meeting   of Shareholders, publication of interim reports, public presentations and dividend payment date if   appropriate. This overview is available on SNL’s website. </p>
<p> After each quarterly earnings release, SNL holds a conference call to discuss the results and respond to   investor and analyst questions. The conference call is open to all those who wish to participate. Twice   per year the results conference call is held in front of a live audience. All conference calls have a   telephone dial-in and are webcast with playback options available. </p>
<p><h2> 14. Take-overs </h2>
 The Board of Directors will publicly disclose any serious offer for SNL or a substantial portion of the   assets of SNL and will follow the recommendation in the Norwegian Code of Practice if any serious offer   is received. The Board of Directors will also obtain a fairness opinion or valuation from an independent   third party for any material transactions between SNL and affiliates such as: members of the Board of   Directors, members of the executive management or close associates of any such parties; and between   companies in the same group where any of the companies involved have minority shareholders. </p>
<p> <b>Corporate Governance continued</b> </p>
<p><h2> 15. Auditor </h2>
 The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment and supervision of independent external   auditors. Under Bermuda law the independent external auditor is appointed by the General Meeting.   The Audit Committee may only propose the name of the independent auditor. The Audit Committee has   established guidelines in respect of the use of the Independent Auditors by the Company’s executive   management for services other than the audit. The Audit Committee shall receive annual written   confirmation from the Independent Auditors that such firm continues to satisfy the requirements   for independence. In addition, the Independent Auditors shall provide the Audit Committee with   a summary of all services in addition to audit work that have been undertaken for the Company.    The Independent Auditors shall submit the main features of the plan for the audit of SNL to the    Audit Committee annually. </p>
<p> The Independent Auditors shall participate in meetings of the Audit Committee that deal with the   annual accounts and quarterly results. At these meetings, the Independent Auditors shall comment    on any material changes in the Company’s accounting principles, comment on material management   estimates and judgements, and report all matters on which there has been disagreement between   the firm and the executive management of the Company. </p>
<p> The Independent Auditors shall at least once a year present to the Audit Committee commentary   on any significant internal control findings arising during the audit. </p>
<p> The Audit Committee shall hold a meeting with the Independent Auditors at least once a year at    which neither the CEO nor any other member of the executive management is present.  </p>

<p><h1> Consolidated Income Statements </h1>
</p>
<p> Net profit attributable to equity holders of SNL was $106.1 million for 2010, an increase of    $10.9 million from 2009. This was primarily due to an increase in operating profit, which increased    to $160.9 million from $123.6 million, or $37.2 million. The most significant factors affecting SNL’s   performance in 2010 were: </p>
<p> <b>“ </b>  <b>Net profit attributable </b>  <b>to equity holders of </b>  <b>SNL was $106.1 million </b>  <b>for 2010, an increase </b>  <b>of $10.9 million  </b>  <b>from 2009.”</b> </p>
<p> <b>Jan Chr. Engelhardtsen</b>  Chief Financial Officer </p>
<p> • Stolt Tankers reported operating profit of $31.4 million versus $24.8 million, reflecting higher   volumes, a higher gain on sale of assets and lower administrative and general expenses. </p>
<p> • Stolthaven Terminals reported an operating profit of $56.9 million up from $50.0 million, driven by   increased capacity and throughput activity. During 2010, Stolthaven saw a slow recovery in its U.S.   terminals while the Brazilian facility and joint ventures in Europe and South Korea experienced a   much stronger storage market compared to 2009, reflecting strong demand and opportunities for    rate increases. </p>
<p> • Stolt Tank Containers reported an operating profit of $64.3 million, up from $54.2 million as a result   of increased shipment volumes and improved utilisation of tanks. </p>
<p> • Stolt Sea Farm reported an operating profit of $12.6 million, an increase from $4.5 million as   Stolt Sea Farm recognised a $5.8 million increase between years from the fair value accounting for   inventories and as a result of higher demand because of reduced competition and improved markets   in Europe. </p>
<p> • Stolt-Nielsen Gas reported a loss for the year of $6.7 million, compared with a loss of $1.2 million    a year ago, as a result of it being the first full year of operations in a weak market for Very Large   Gas Containers (VLGCs). </p>
<p> • Finance income increased to $47.7 million from $5.3 million, or $42.4 million from interest received   on the refund of the progress payments upon the cancellation of eight new building contracts at   SLS Shipbuilding Co. Ltd (SLS). Partially offsetting this was the increase in finance expenses to   $72.6 million from $30.7 million, or $41.9 million, due to the write-off of previously capitalised   interest on the SLS newbuildings of $28.4 million and lower capitalised interest as a majority of   the newbuildings have been delivered. </p>
<p><h2> Operating Revenue </h2>
 Operating revenue for 2010 increased by $148.5 million or 9.0% due largely to the improvement    in economic conditions, which affected all of SNL’s markets. Stolt Tankers’ revenue increased by    $59.9 million due to increased volumes and improved utilisation during the year in both the deep-sea   and regional fleets as well as a $25.6 million increase in bunker-surcharge revenue. Stolt Tankers   reported 127 more operating days as time chartered ships were utilised and newbuildings were   delivered, offsetting the impact of older ships being recycled.  </p>
<p> Stolthaven revenues increased by $9.3 million or 7.8% against 2009, primarily reflecting increased   capacity in the New Orleans and Santos terminals. </p>
<p> Stolt Tank Containers’ revenue increased by $68.4 million or 15.9% as total shipments rose by 14.9%   and utilisation increased by 10.9% due to a strengthening of the market. This was mainly due to the   markets rebounding from the global recession that began in late 2008 which affected global demand   for tank containers throughout 2009. </p>
<p> Stolt Sea Farm’s operating revenue increased by $6.3 million from 2009, primarily reflecting a 9.6%   increase in turbot volumes and an 8.0% increase in turbot prices. </p>
<p><h2> Gross Profit </h2>
 SNL’s gross profit increased by $7.5 million to $283.3 million, an increase of 2.7% compared with   2009, reflecting the increased demand in STC and Stolt Sea Farm, partly offset by a reduction in    Stolt Tankers’ gross profit of $8.0 million. While the increase in bunkers was almost completely offset   by bunker surcharge revenue and lower bunker hedge losses in 2010, time charter and depreciation   expenses increased as SNL entered into new time charters and newbuildings were delivered to   compensate for cancellation of SLS newbuildings. </p>
<p> Stolt Tank Containers saw an improved gross profit of $9.2 million from the prior year as demand   increased and margins rebounded in 2010, with increased freight costs being passed on to customers.   Stolthaven Terminals, however, showed a $1.6 million decrease in gross profit due to higher operational   expenses related to higher throughput activity and start-up costs from the Singapore terminal. This   more than offset the 7.8% increase in operating revenue from increased capacity and throughputs.   Stolt Sea Farm’s gross profit increased by $8.4 million, partially caused by a $5.8 million increase in   the fair value adjustment to its inventory and by higher turbot prices. </p>
<p> <b>Financial Review continued</b> </p>
<p><h2> Share of Profit of Joint Ventures and Associates </h2>
 SNL’s share of the profit from joint ventures and associates in 2010 was $24.7 million, up from   $19.7 million in 2009.  </p>
<p> Income from the Company’s regional tanker joint ventures with Nippon Yusen Kaisha decreased   by $4.1 million due to higher bunker costs and depreciation expenses, while the income from the   deep-sea tanker joint venture, NYK Stolt Tankers S.A. increased by $1.8 million. </p>
<p> Income from Stolthaven’s joint venture with JSTT in South Korea increased by $3.5 million, driven   by increased capacity and rates, capitalisation of interest and lower depreciation. The Company’s joint   venture with Oiltanking in Antwerp, Belgium, reported increased income of $1.9 million, mostly from   increased capacity and utilisation. </p>
<p><h2> Administrative and General Expenses </h2>
 Administrative and general expenses decreased to $158.0 million in 2010 from $171.5 million in 2009, a   reduction of $13.5 million. This was primarily due to a decrease in antitrust legal expenses to $0.5 million   in 2010 from $7.4 million in 2009, reduced legal settlement expenses and a stronger US dollar. This was   partially offset by $3.4 million of higher profit sharing and long-term incentive plan expenses. </p>
<p><h2> Restructuring Charges </h2>
 SNL’s restructuring charges in 2009 related to the restructuring of Stolt Tank Containers in Europe   following the 2008 acquisition of the Taby Group and the outsourcing of business technology services. </p>
<p><h2> Gain on Disposal of Assets, Net </h2>
 In 2010, SNL recorded a net gain on the disposal of assets of $7.2 million in 2010, compared with   $0.4 million in 2009. The 2010 net gain primarily related to the recycling and sale of five ships for   $5.4 million and the sale of four ships to Gulf Stolt Tankers for $1.7 million. The 2009 gain primarily   related to the sale of tank containers and other assets, offset by the recycling of ships for a loss   of $0.5 million.  </p>
<p><h2> Other Operating Income and Other Operating Expense </h2>
 Other operating income in 2010 was higher by $2.5 million, primarily due to a fee paid by a joint   venture. Other operating expense decreased by $1.4 million. </p>
<p><h2> Finance Expense </h2>
 Finance (interest) expense was $72.6 million in 2010, up from $30.7 million in 2009. Capitalised   interest previously recorded on the SLS progress payments of $28.4 million was reversed when the   eight SLS ship contracts were cancelled, as it was determined that the yard would not be able to   deliver the ships on schedule. In addition, capitalised interest in connection with the Company’s   newbuilding programme decreased by $16.4 million between the two years as the majority of the   newbuildings (other than the SLS contracted ships) have been delivered.  </p>
<p><h2> Finance Income </h2>
 Finance income was higher by $42.4 million during 2010 as the Group received interest of $44.2 million   on the refund of the SLS progress payments upon the cancellation of the eight ship contracts.  </p>
<p><h2> Foreign Currency Exchange Gain  </h2>
 In 2010, SNL had a foreign exchange gain of $2.6 million, compared with a $7.7 million gain in 2009.   While the US dollar was stronger in 2010 against most currencies, SNL’s exposure to foreign currencies   was higher in 2009. </p>
<p><h2> Non-operating (Loss) Income </h2>
 The non-operating loss of $5.4 million was a result of the write-off of the debt issuance costs related   to the SLS related debt. </p>
<p><h2> Income Tax Expense </h2>
 The income tax expense for 2010 was $20.5 million, which was an $11.1 million increase from the   prior year provision of $9.5 million. The income tax expense for 2010 was $20.6 million, which was   a $11.1 million increase from the prior year provision of $9.5 million. Of this total, $4.9 million was   due to an increase in 2010 of taxable income in more highly taxed jurisdictions and the remaining   $6.2 million increase was due to a reduction in 2010 of credits relating to prior year taxes. </p>
<p><h2> Non-controlling Interest </h2>
 The non-controlling interest mainly relates to a non-controlling interest in Stolt Sea Farm’s 75%   investment in Sterling Caviar.  </p>
<p><h1> Business Segment Information </h1>
</p>
<p> This section summarises SNL’s operating performance for each of its principal business segments.   The “Corporate and Other” category includes Corporate-related expenses and all other operations, such   as Stolt Bitumen Services and Stolt-Nielsen Gas, which are not reportable under the other segments. </p>

<p><h1> Stolt Tankers </h1>
</p>
<p><h2> Operating Revenue </h2>
 Operating revenue increased by $59.9 million or 5.8% from 2009 to 2010. For the deep-sea fleet, the   revenue increase was partially attributable to an increase in Contracts of Affreightment (COA) volumes   and fewer ballast repositioning voyages in 2010. Rates remained reasonably stable between the   periods. For the regional fleets revenue increased due to an increase in operating days.  </p>
<p> As of November 30, 2010, Stolt Tankers owned and/or operated 150 ships, representing 2.52 million   deadweight tons (dwt) (2009: 2.30 million dwt). </p>

<p> Cargo volume carried in 2010 by the STJS was 11.1 million tons versus 10.8 million tons in 2009 as   volumes began to recover from the global recession that started in late 2008. Operating days increased   by approximately 127 days compared with the same period last year. The increase in trading days   reflected the timing of the delivery of eight newbuildings and the net increase of an average of one   time charter ship in the course of 2009 and 2010, partially offset by the recycling or sale of 10 ships   during the same period.  </p>
<p> COA freight rates during 2010 were on average 1.6% lower due to a change in the mix of products   carried, while spot rates increased by 0.8%. </p>
<p> <b>Financial Review continued</b> </p>
<p> Total regional fleet revenue increased to $206.8 million from $186.6 million or 10.8% due to an   increase in operating days. </p>
<p> Revenue for the deep sea and regional fleets in 2010 also benefited from a $25.6 million increase   in bunker-surcharge billings, due to higher bunker fuel prices. </p>
<p> The Sailed-In Time-Charter Index is a measure of the daily sailed-in rate for the STJS indexed to the   rate for the fleet during the first quarter of 1990. During the period from 1990 to 2010, the average   annual Sailed-In Time-Charter Index ranged from a high of 1.35 in 1995 to a low of 0.93 in 1999   and averaged 1.15. The average Sailed-In Time-Charter Index for 2010 was 1.17 compared with   1.10 in 2009. </p>
<p><h2> Operating Profit </h2>
 Operating profit increased to $31.4 million in 2010 from $24.8 million in 2009, while operating   margins increased to 2.9% in 2010 from 2.4% in 2009. The operating profit and the related margin   increased primarily due to fewer ballast voyages, higher bunker surcharge revenue, lower administrative   and general expenses, a higher gain on the sale of assets and lower bunker hedge losses. This was   offset by higher bunker costs, depreciation expense, port charges and time charter costs. </p>
<p> Bunker expenses, excluding hedging losses, increased by $74.6 million in 2010 compared with 2009.   This was primarily due to the average price of IFO consumed during 2010 increasing to approximately   $466 per ton compared with $345 per ton during 2009. The effect of this net increase was partially   offset by the effect of bunker hedging, which resulted in a gain of $1.8 million in 2010 compared to a   loss of $46.2 million in 2009. Port charges increased to more normal levels as COA volumes rebounded   in 2010. In 2009, SNL carried more large parcels of spot commodities, resulting in fewer port calls.   Time charter costs were higher as short-term time charter ships were hired during 2010 to replace   ships being dry-docked and a series of time charters were entered into with JO Tankers. Time charter   payments to the joint service participants increased due to the entry of Gulf Stolt Tankers and there   was increased activity by the regional fleets.  </p>
<p> Ship owning costs increased by 2.0% in 2010 due to increased depreciation from the addition of   newbuildings to the fleet and higher maintenance and repair expenses, partially offset by reduced   insurance deductibles and foreign exchange hedging gains.  </p>
<p><h1> Stolthaven Terminals </h1>
</p>
<p><h2> Operating Revenue </h2>
 Stolthaven Terminals’ revenue increased to $128.1 million in 2010 from $118.8 million in 2009, an   increase of 7.8% due to additional capacity added to Stolthaven’s wholly owned terminals in Santos   and New Orleans in 2009 and 2010 and increased throughput in Houston and New Orleans, though   overall utilisation fell to 95.5% from 97.0%.  </p>
<p> Total average monthly available capacity at the wholly-owned terminals increased to 887,000 cubic   metres in 2010 from an average of 801,000 cubic metres in 2009, an increase of 10.8% as a result   of adding additional capacity. Product handled increased to 6.9 million cubic metres in 2010 from   6.0 million cubic metres in 2009 as the global economy began to recover from the downturn. </p>
<p><h2> Operating Profit </h2>
 Operating profit increased to $56.9 million in 2010 from $50.0 million in 2009 as a result of the   increase in the Company’s share of profit of joint ventures. The increase in revenue from Stolthaven’s   wholly owned terminals mentioned above was more than offset by an increase in operating expenses,   resulting in a lower operating profit for the wholly-owned terminals.  </p>
<p> Income at Stolthaven’s joint venture in South Korea increased by $3.5 million due to an increase   in capacity, a change in the estimated useful lives of the terminal assets, and an increase in the   capitalisation of interest. Income at Oiltanking in Antwerp, Belgium increased by $1.9 million,   driven by increased capacity and a strong mineral oil market. Income from Stolthaven’s joint   venture in Lingang, China rose by $1.6 million due to increased tank utilisation. </p>
<p> Operating expenses increased to $73.9 million in 2010 from $63.0 million in 2009, due to higher   labour, utility, property liability insurance and depreciation expenses. The increase was primarily   caused by increased capacity and throughput activity resulting from the recovery from the   economic downturn.  </p>
<p><h1> Stolt Tank Containers (STC) </h1>
</p>
<p><h2> Operating Revenue </h2>
 Stolt Tank Containers’ revenues increased to $498.3 million in 2010 from $429.9 million in 2009, an   increase of 15.9%, due primarily to increased shipment volumes, which rose 14.9% in 2010. This was   mainly due to markets rebounding from the global recession that began in late 2008 which affected   global demand for tank containers in 2009. </p>
<p> In 2010, STC handled 108,291 container shipments compared with 94,223 shipments in 2009, a 14.9%   increase. Utilisation was 74.4% in 2010, up from 67.1% in 2009. The fleet increased to 24,345 tank   containers at the end of 2010 versus 23,919 tank containers at the end of 2009, due to the purchase   of new tanks offset by the return of higher cost, leased tank containers.  </p>
<p> STC’s rates in most major markets increased on average as rates were adjusted to compensate for higher   ocean freight and inland trucking costs. While freight costs have been rising since the middle of 2009,   rates to customers only began increasing in mid-2010 due to strong competition. </p>
<p><h2> Operating Profit </h2>
 Stolt Tank Containers’ operating profit increased to $64.3 million in 2010 from $54.2 million in 2009,   while its operating margin increased to 12.9% in 2010 from 12.6% in 2009. The operating-margin   increase was due to lower leased tank rental costs and depreciation, as well as reduced administrative   and general expenses. </p>
<p><h1> Stolt Sea Farm (SSF) </h1>
</p>
<p><h2> Operating Revenue </h2>
 Stolt Sea Farm’s revenue increased by 13.1% or $6.3 million in 2010, from 2009. Turbot volumes sold   were up 9.6% from 2009, reflecting reduced competition in a low demand market. Turbot demand   was particularly weak in Spain, SSF’s main market for Turbot, which was suffering from the economic   downturn. Turbot prices rose 8.0% from 2009 due to reduced competition. Caviar volumes also   increased during 2010 from the same period in 2009, while prices fell in line with lower demand   for luxury goods. </p>
<p><h2> Operating Profit </h2>
 Stolt Sea Farm’s operating profit increased by $8.0 million and the operating margin rose to 23% in   2010 compared with 9% in 2009, due to the increase in market prices. In addition, SSF recognised   a $5.8 million increase between years from the fair value accounting for inventories. </p>
<p><h1> Stolt-Nielsen Gas </h1>
</p>
<p> Subsequent to year end, SNL’s subsidiary, Avance Gas Holding Ltd. (AGHL) acquired three VLGCs owned   by Sungas Holdings Ltd (Sungas) for $211.4 million. As payment for the ships, AGHL issued to Sungas   common shares worth $56.7 million for a 50% ownership in AGHL in addition to $154.7 million in cash.   The cash payment, as well as $20.0 million for working capital, was funded by shareholder loans from   SNL and Sungas. A shareholder agreement was entered into between Sungas and Stolt-Nielsen Gas Limited   which provides that the future operations of AGHL will be jointly controlled by the shareholders.  </p>
<p> As a result of the transaction, SNL has deconsolidated AGHL, effective December 2, 2010, and will   account for it using the equity method in the future. AGHL will continue to manage SNL’s operations   in the transportation of LPG using VLGCs. For 2009 and 2010, the results of AGHL are being shown as   a discontinued operation.  </p>

<p><h2> Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities </h2>
 In 2010, SNL generated cash from operations of $218.0 million, compared with $230.3 million in 2009.   While profit before depreciation and other non-cash items increased in 2010 from 2009, the change   in cash tied up in the working capital accounts, especially accounts receivable, was $69.7 million less   in 2010 than in 2009. The large change in 2009 was primarily the effect of lower revenues in 2009,   compared with 2008, as well as increased collection efforts. While activity has increased in 2010,   the working capital account balances have remained consistent with the prior year. </p>
<p><h2> Net Cash Used for Investing Activities </h2>
 Cash provided by investing activities was $122.9 million in 2010, compared with cash used for   investing activities of $195.8 million in 2009. </p>
<p> The most significant uses of cash for investing during 2010 were capital expenditures of $277.0 million,   which primarily related to the Company’s newbuilding programme and were $27.6 million higher than in   2009, and investments in joint ventures of $40.0 million. The latter was primarily due to contributions   to Gulf Stolt Tankers for the acquisition of four ships from SNL. Offsetting the uses of cash were   (i) $295.8 million from the refund by SLS of progress payments on newbuildings and (ii) $209.0 million   from the sale of ships and other assets compared with $14.0 million in 2009. In 2009, SNL received   repayments of advances from Oiltanking Stolthaven Antwerp N.V. of $43.3 million. </p>
<p> Capital expenditures by business are summarised below. </p>
<p> For the years ended November 30,  <b>2010</b>  2009   (in thousands)  Stolt Tankers  <b>$</b>  <b>218,675</b>  $   207,724   Stolthaven Terminals  <b> 31,143</b>  29,626  Stolt Tank Containers  <b>19,752</b>  4,679  Stolt Sea Farm  <b>1,530</b>  4,900  Corporate and other  <b> 5,866</b>  2,394  </p>
<p> <b>Total SNL</b>  <b>$</b>  <b>276,966</b>  $   249,323  </p>
<p> Capital expenditures for the year included (i) $126.9 million for deposits and progress payments on   six newbuildings in Stolt Tankers, (ii) $65.5 million for the purchase of three second-hand ships, (iii)   $18.9 million for downpayments on five second-hand ships to be delivered in 2011, (iv) $14.9 million   for construction costs for a terminal on Jurong Island in Singapore, (v) $16.4 million for new tank   containers and (vi) $11.1 million for progress payments on new Bitumen ships. Included in   investments from discontinued operations was the purchase of the VLGC,   Stolt Avance  .  </p>
<p><h2> Net Cash Used for Financing Activities </h2>
 Net cash used for financing activities totalled $333.6 million in 2010 compared with $34.3 million   in 2009. </p>
<p> The principal uses of cash for financing activities in 2010 were (i) $29.9 million in dividend payments,   which were consistent with 2009, (ii) $258.2 million in repayment of long-term debt and finance   leases, compared with $66.1 million in 2009, and (iii) net repayment of short-term bank loans of   $210.9 million, versus $122.4 million in 2009. The significant cash sources from 2010 financial   activities included net proceeds of long-term debt issuances of $165.1 million, compared with   $185.9 million in 2009. The debt issuances were secured by new or existing parcel tankers.  </p>
<p><h1> Indebtedness </h1>
</p>
<p> SNL’s total consolidated debt was $992.6 million and $1,280.4 million, while unused short-term   facilities were $478.2 million and $362.7 million, as of November 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively,   as set forth in the table below: </p>
<p> As of November 30,  <b> 2010</b>  2009   (in thousands)   Long-term debt (including current portion)  <b>$</b>  <b>847,614</b>  $   924,507  Committed short-term bank loans  <b>145,000</b>  345,000   Uncommitted short-term bank loans  <b>–</b>  10,900  Total debt on consolidated financial statements  <b>992,614</b>   1,280,407  Available unused facilities:  Committed short-term bank loans  <b>452,400</b>  350,900  Uncommitted short-term bank loans  <b>25,800</b>  11,800  Total unused facilities  <b>478,200</b>  362,700  Total debt and unused facilities  <b>$</b>  <b>1,470,814</b>  $  1,643,107 </p>
<p> <b>Financial Review continued</b> </p>
<p><h2> Short-Term Debt </h2>
 Short-term debt consists of debt obligations to banks under multi-year revolving credit agreements,   uncommitted lines of credit and bank overdraft facilities. SNL classifies its credit agreements as   short-term debt although the facilities have been committed to by the banks for multiple years.   Amounts borrowed pursuant to these facilities bear interest at rates ranging from 1.1% to 1.3% in   2010, and from 1.1% to 6.0% in 2009. The weighted average interest rates were 1.2% and 1.5% for   the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Committed short-term credit lines amount   to $597.4 million, of which $452.4 million was unused at November 30, 2010. Future availability is   dependent on maintaining sufficient collateral. Collateral values could fluctuate with fluctuations in   ship prices. In addition the Company has access to $25.8 million of uncommitted lines and overdraft   facilities, which can be withdrawn by the banks on short notice. </p>
<p><h2> Long-Term Debt </h2>
 Long-term debt consists of debt collateralised by mortgages on the Company’s ships and terminals.   It does not include the off-balance sheet arrangements discussed below. SNL’s long-term debt was   $847.6 million and $924.5 million as of November 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as set forth below: </p>
<p> As of November 30,  <b>2010</b>  2009  (in thousands)   Long-term debt  <b>$</b>  <b> 847,614</b>  $  924,507  Less: Current maturities  <b> (106,171)</b>  (84,035)     <b>$</b>  <b> 741,443</b>  $  840,472 </p>
<p><h1> Reconciliation of Net Cash Flow to Movement in Net Debt </h1>
</p>
<p> SNL had the following changes in net debt, which is defined as short-term loans and long-term debt   and finance leases, less cash and cash equivalents. </p>
<p> For the years ended November 30,  <b>2010</b>   2009  (in thousands)  Increase in cash and cash equivalents for the year  <b>$</b>  <b>4,460</b>  $  4,202  Cash inflow from increase in debt  <b>(165,064)</b>  (185,946)  Cash outflow from repayments of debt and finance leases  <b>469,108</b>  188,415  Change in net debt resulting from cash flows  <b>308,504</b>  6,671  Currency, debt issuance costs and other movements  <b>(16,251)</b>  (7,064)  Movement in net debt in the year  <b>292,253</b>  (393)  Opening net debt  <b>(1,241,948)</b>  (1,241,555)  Closing net debt  <b>$</b>  <b>(949,695)</b>  $  (1,241,948) </p>
<p> During 2010 SNL met its liquidity needs through a combination of cash generated from operations,   borrowings from commercial banks, refunds of progress payments from newbuildings, and proceeds   from the sale of assets. </p>
<p> Generally, Stolt Tankers was able to operate with a negative working capital due to the tight credit   terms extended to customers, keeping accounts receivable to a minimum, while maintaining standard   credit terms of 30 to 90 days obtained from suppliers. For Stolt Tank Containers and Stolthaven   Terminals, a normal business operating cycle prevails with balanced credit terms. For Stolt Sea Farm,   the production cycle for various farmed fish species transpires over several months to years, requiring   a normal working capital to finance inventory.  </p>
<p> Ships and tank containers can be an important source of liquidity, as these assets can be used to   secure debt or can be sold and, if needed, leased back. SNL realised proceeds from the sales of ships   and other assets of $209.0 million in 2010, versus $14.0 million in 2009. The proceeds in 2010   included the sale of four parcel tankers to its joint venture, Gulf Stolt Tankers. </p>
<p> The Company believes that SNL’s cash flow from operations and available credit facilities will continue   to provide the cash necessary to satisfy the Company’s working capital requirements and capital   expenditures, as well as to make scheduled debt repayments, remain in compliance with SNL’s financial   covenants and satisfy the Company’s other financial commitments for at least the next 12 months from   February 18, 2011. </p>
<p> As of November 30, 2010, SNL directly owned 62 ships and barges having a total net book value   of $1,520.2 million. Of the 62 total ships and barges, nine barges and four ships with a total net   book value of $87.1 million were unencumbered, while 49 ships with a total net book value of   $1,433.1 million were collateralising total credit facilities of $1,259.1 million, of which $806.7 million   was drawn down at year end. As of November 30, 2010, SNL also owned 15,004 tank containers that   are unencumbered, having a total net book value of $173.8 million.  </p>
<p><h1> Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements </h1>
</p>
<p> In addition to the obligations recorded on SNL’s consolidated balance sheets, certain commitments   and contingencies that may result in future cash requirements are not recorded on the Company’s   consolidated balance sheets. In addition to the long-term debt interest payments discussed above,   these off-balance sheet arrangements consist of operating leases, committed capital expenditures and   the retained and contingent interests discussed below.  </p>
<p><h2> Operating Leases </h2>
 SNL’s operating lease commitments were $496.4 million at November 30, 2010, compared with   $349.6 million at November 30, 2009. As of November 30, 2010, SNL was obligated to make payments   under long-term operating lease agreements for tankers, a LPG ship, terminal facilities, tank containers,   barges, computer and office equipment and offices. Certain of the leases contain clauses requiring   payments in excess of the base amounts to cover operating expenses related to the leased assets. </p>
<p><h2> Time Charter of Nine Ships </h2>
 To replace ships that may be recycled or reassigned into less demanding trading activities because   of age, SNL has entered into agreements with various Japanese ship owners for time charters of nine   ships with stainless steel tanks. As of November 30, 2010, all time charters have commenced. The nine   time charters are for an initial period of 36 to 96 months and include the option for SNL to extend   the agreements for up to nine additional years. SNL also has the option to purchase each ship at   predetermined prices at any time after three years from the delivery of the ship. The contractual cash   obligation schedule below includes the leases as these commitments occurred prior to November 30,   2010. These operating leases, which are included in the total lease commitments of $496.4 million   discussed above, had commitments for the initial periods of $70.0 million as of November 30, 2010   for the period 2010 through 2016. SNL acquired two of the time chartered ships in 2010. </p>
<p><h1> Contractual Obligations </h1>
</p>
<p> SNL has various contractual obligations, some of which are required to be recorded as liabilities in the   Consolidated Financial Statements. SNL’s operating leases, committed capital expenditures, long-term   debt interest payments and other executory contracts are not required to be recognised as liabilities on   the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. As of November 30, 2010, SNL’s other purchase obligations   were not material. The following summarises SNL’s significant contractual obligations as of November 30,   2010, including those reported on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and others that are not: </p>

(3)    Pension and post-retirement benefits contributions – SNL includes these amounts based on current estimates of   contribution to the pension plans that may be required. The Company has not disclosed possible payments beyond   the next 12 months due to the significant difficulty in forecasting these amounts with any accuracy.  </p>
<p> <b>Financial Review continued</b> </p>
<p><h1> Financial Risk Management </h1>
</p>
<p> SNL is exposed to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.   The Company’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets   and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on SNL’s financial performance. This is covered in more   detail in Note 31 to the financial statements. </p>
<p><h1> Critical Accounting Estimates </h1>
</p>
<p> In the preparation of SNL’s financial statements, there are a number of areas where assumptions have   been made about the future, management judgements and estimates. Such areas could experience a   significantly different outcome should these assumptions, judgements and estimates differ from actual   results. The key areas where estimates and judgements make significant differences are: </p>
<p> • Voyage revenue and costs; </p>
<p> • Depreciation and residual values; </p>
<p> • Impairment of ships; </p>
<p> • Investments in joint ventures and associates; </p>
<p> • Biological assets; </p>
<p> • Goodwill impairment testing; and, </p>
<p> • Pension and other post-retirement benefits. </p>
<p> To obtain a better understanding of SNL’s detailed accounting policies in these areas, please see Note 2   to the financial statements included in this Annual Report. </p>
<p><h1> Principal Risks </h1>
</p>
<p> Each business segment considers strategic, operational and financial risks and identifies actions to   mitigate those risks. These risk profiles are updated at least annually. The principal risks and   uncertainties for the next financial year are discussed below.  </p>
<p><h2> Bunker Fuel and Freight Costs </h2>
 Bunker fuel constitutes one of the major operating costs of the tanker fleet and increasing prices   can have a material impact on SNL’s results. Although efforts are made to reduce the impact of price   changes by passing bunker fuel costs through to customers or through the Company’s bunker hedging   programme, a significant portion is incurred solely by the Company. Approximately 73% of Stolt   Tankers’ total revenue in 2010 was derived from COA. During that same time period, approximately   84% of the revenue earned under COA was under contracts that included provisions intended to pass   through fluctuations in fuel prices to customers. The profitability of the remaining 16% of Stolt Tankers’   revenue earned under COA was directly impacted by changes in fuel prices, subject to the Company’s   hedging programme. SNL’s policy is to hedge a minimum of 50% of expected bunker purchases within   the next 12 months through either bunker surcharges included in COA or through hedging. </p>
<p> For Stolt Tank Containers, the impact of increased freight costs due to tight capacity on container   ships in selected markets, such as the U.S., and the global increase in fuel prices can result in   continued downward pressure on margins. Cost increases are passed on to customers when possible.   Given quoted rate validity periods to customers, there is a negative impact on margins until rates can   be increased. </p>
<p><h2> Tanker Industry Risk </h2>
 The tanker industry is cyclical and volatile, which may lead to reductions and/or volatility in freight   rates, volumes and ship values. Fluctuations in the rates that Stolt Tankers can charge result from   changes in the supply and demand for ship capacity and changes in the supply and demand for the   products carried, particularly the bulk liquids, chemicals, edible oils, acids and other specialty liquids   that are the majority of the products that the Company transports. Factors influencing demand include   supply for products shipped, economic growth, environmental development and the distances that   products are moved by sea. Factors influencing supply include the number of new ships and recycling   of old ships, changes in regulations and availability of newbuildings at shipyards. </p>
<p> Stolt Tankers mitigates this risk by actively managing the mix of business between COA and spot and   utilises various tools to increase fleet flexibility and risk. Contract business tends to be less volatile in   terms of both rates and volumes than spot business. Management endeavours to increase the contract   percentage and lengthen contract duration during periods of uncertainty or when management determines   that market conditions are likely to deteriorate. In general, Stolt Tankers maintains a relatively high   percentage of contract business. Stolt Tankers also actively manages its charter periods to allow a certain   number of ships to be redelivered on short notice. Within the owned fleet, Stolt Tankers endeavors to   maintain a balanced age profile. Through this technique, fleet size can be managed by early retirement   of older ships when demand is soft and life extension of ships during periods of higher demand. </p>
<p><h2> Political and Geopolitical Risk </h2>
 SNL has international operations, and the business, financial condition and results of operations may   be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and   regions where the SNL’s ships and tank containers are employed and terminals are located.  </p>
<p> SNL is also exposed to geopolitical risks where territorial and other disputes between countries could   lead to the outbreak of war or the existence of international hostilities that could damage the world   economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for petroleum and chemical products and   adversely affect SNL’s ability to operate ships, terminals or tank containers. Moreover, SNL operates in   a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability,   terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities. </p>
<p> For an effective and competitive global chemical shipping business, effectively managing geopolitical   risk is a strategic imperative. Cross border expansion to facilitate corporate growth is a significant   contributor to growth. In some cases, cargoes are located in or destined for troubled or developing   markets where considerable cultural, infrastructure, security or technology challenges must be met.   At the same time, population growth, especially in Asia, is creating new demand for petroleum and   chemical products. Sufficient supply must be in place with supporting infrastructure and distribution   to meet these high growth markets. </p>
<p><h2> Terminal Project Risks </h2>
 Stolthaven has entered into three joint ventures in China to build and manage two chemical and   oil-products terminals in Tianjin and Ningbo and has established an ownership interest in jetties in   Tianjin. The Company has also begun construction of a chemical storage terminal on Jurong Island,   Singapore. The development of terminal operations and jetties involves significant up-front investment   in infrastructure and there are certain risks inherent in such developments, including political,   regulatory, currency exchange, liquidity, financial, contractual and structural risks. The occurrence   of one or more of these risk factors could delay the project and as a result in increased project costs.   Different countries carry varying degrees of risk depending on social, cultural, political and financial   development and stability. Efforts are made to mitigate these risks by employing local country and   regional representatives to act as liaisons with local authorities and to devise appropriate exit   strategies for the operations.  </p>
<p><h2> Sea Farm Biological Asset Inventory Price Risk  </h2>
 All mature turbot are held at fair value less costs of sale and costs related to harvest. Sturgeon and the   caviar they produce are fair valued at the point of harvest. A fair value adjustment is also made at the   point when previously juvenile turbot are considered to become mature, which typically occurs when   the fish reach a specified weight. Fair value is determined on the basis of market prices, and gains and   losses from changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement.  </p>
<p> The fair value of these assets fluctuates significantly based upon the season, competition, market   conditions and existing supply. The fair value adjustment recognised in the current year was a   $5.2 million increase compared with a $0.6 million decrease in 2009. There is a risk that the fair   value adjustment recognised in a year could negatively impact SNL’s income statement. </p>
<p><h2> Currency Risk </h2>
 Most of the revenue earned by Stolt Tankers and Stolt Tank Containers is in U.S. dollars while a   significant portion of their operating expenses is incurred in other currencies, primarily the Euro,   the Norwegian kroner, the Singapore dollar, Chinese Renminbi and the British pound. When there  </p>
<p> <b>Financial Review continued</b> </p>
<p> is a mismatch between revenue and expense currencies, any depreciation of the revenue currency   relative to the expense currency will decrease profit margins.  </p>
<p> On average in 2010, the U.S. dollar appreciated by 2% against the euro, causing an increase in profit   margins. This risk is partially mitigated through SNL’s foreign currency hedging programme. SNL’s policy   is to hedge approximately 50% to 80% of the Company’s expected future foreign currency exposure and   100% of its future committed capital expenditures denominated in foreign currencies. </p>

<p><h2> Independent auditors’ report </h2>
</p>
<p> To the shareholders and Board of directors of Stolt-Nielsen Limited </p>
<p> <b>Report on the financial statements </b>  We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Stolt-Nielsen Limited and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’), which comprise the   consolidated balance sheets as at 30 November 2010 and the consolidated income statements, consolidated statements of comprehensive income,   consolidated statements of changes in shareholders’ equity and consolidated statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of   significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. </p>
<p> <b>Management’s responsibility for the consolidated financial statements</b>  Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting   Standards as adopted by the European Union and in accordance with applicable law in Bermuda. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and   maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether   due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.  </p>
<p> <b>Auditor’s responsibility</b>  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with   International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable   assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.  </p>
<p> This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the group’s members as a body in accordance with Section 90 of The Companies Act   1981 (Bermuda) and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person   to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. </p>
<p> An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected   depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due   to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the   consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an   opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the   reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  </p>
<p> We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. </p>
<p> <b>Opinion</b>  In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as of   30 November 2010, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting   Standards as adopted by the European Union and in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1981 (Bermuda). </p>

<p> The Group is also engaged in the seafood business, which is carried out   through Stolt Sea Farm (“SSF”), and produces, processes and markets turbot,   sturgeon, caviar and sole. Furthermore, the Group has a start-up operation   for the storage and distribution of bitumen.  </p>
<p> On November 16, 2010, the Boards of Directors of each of Stolt-Nielsen   Limited and Stolt-Nielsen S.A., approved a merger by absorption and   amalgamation of Stolt-Nielsen S.A. into and with Stolt-Nielsen Limited. The   amalgamated company has continued as an exempted company under the   laws of Bermuda. As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Stolt-Nielsen   S.A. and Stolt-Nielsen Limited have become the assets and liabilities of the   merged company, Stolt-Nielsen Limited, upon the Merger becoming effective   on November 18, 2010 in accordance with the Companies Act of 1981 of   Bermuda (the “Bermuda Companies Act”) by way of amalgamation, and as   a merger under the law of 10 August 1915 on commercial companies of   Luxembourg, as amended (the “Luxembourg Company Law”). The Common   shares of SNL are listed in Norway on the Oslo Børs. </p>
<p> Upon the completion of the merger, one Common Share in Stolt-Nielsen S.A.   was converted into and became one Common Share in SNL, and one   Founder’s Share in Stolt-Nielsen S.A. became one Founder’s Share in SNL.   The outstanding share capital was therefore unchanged by this transaction.   See Note 2 under Business Combinations for a description of the accounting   method used to record the transaction. </p>
<p> Separate financial statements of the Parent Company, Stolt-Nielsen Limited,   are attached. </p>
<p> The presentation currency used in these consolidated financial statements   is the U.S. dollar. </p>
<p><h2> 2. Significant Accounting Policies  </h2>
 <b>Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements</b>  In connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements,   management has made assumptions and estimates about future events, and   applied judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,   revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. The assumptions, estimates   and judgements are based on historical experience, current trends and other   factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the consolidated   financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews   the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgements to ensure   that the financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with   International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European   Union (“IFRS”) and IFRIC Interpretations. Critical accounting estimates   and judgements are those that have a significant risk of causing material   adjustment. Management believes the following areas are the more   significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of the   Consolidated Financial Statements:  </p>

 <b>Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements </b>  <b>(continued)</b> </p>
<p> Description   Judgements and Uncertainties   Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions <h2> Voyage revenue and costs  </h2>
 The Group generates a majority of its revenues   through its tanker segment from the transportation   of liquids by sea and inland water under contracts   of affreightment or through contracts on the   spot market. Tankers follow the percentage of   completion method with operating revenue and   expenses recognised on each voyage leg. This   recognition is based on “budgeted voyage legs”   that are reviewed and updated annually. After   the voyage legs have begun they are updated for   actual results and the latest updated estimates. </p>
<p> In applying the percentage of completion   method, the revenues and expenses for voyages   still in progress at the end of the reporting period   are estimated and prorated over the period of the   voyage leg. A voyage comprises one or more   “voyage legs.” For each voyage leg, estimates   are made of revenue and related costs based   on available actual information, current market   parameters such as fuel cost and customer   contract portfolios, and relevant historical   data such as port costs.  </p>
<p> Revenue and cost estimates are updated   continually through the voyage to account   for changes in voyage patterns, to include the   most up-to-date data and to finalise revenues    and expenses.  </p>
<p> The accrued voyage and prepaid voyage expense   accounts are used to adjust revenues billed and   vendor invoices received to the appropriate   amounts to be recognised based on the   percentage of completion method of accounting. </p>
<p> Management does not believe there would be a   material change if the percentage of completion   method was based upon criteria other than   voyage legs. However, if actual results are   not consistent with estimates or assumptions,   revenues or costs may be over or under-stated. </p>
<p> At November 30, 2010 and 2009, the accrued   voyage expense account was $64.1 million   and $61.3 million, respectively, in which   $23.7 million and $29.5 million related to   the deferral of revenues.  </p>
<p> Prepaid expenses included $19.1 million and   $29.4 million of prepaid invoices for voyages   in progress applicable to periods subsequent   to November 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. </p>
<p> Description   Judgements and Uncertainties  Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions <h2> Depreciation and Residual Values </h2>
 The Group records the value of the ships at   cost less accumulated depreciation and any   impairment charges. The cost of the ships   includes the contract price, pre-delivery costs   incurred during the construction of newbuildings,   capitalised interest and any material expenses   incurred upon acquisition such as initial repairs,   improvements and delivery expenses to prepare   the ship for its initial voyage. </p>
<p> Ships are depreciated on a straight-line basis over   the ships’ estimated useful lives, after reducing   for the estimated residual values.  </p>
<p> Depreciation is based on the cost of the different   components of the ship less their residual value   and the estimated useful life for similar ships in   the industry. The key judgements and estimates   involved are: </p>
<p> • Estimated useful life of the components of the   ship which range from an estimated 12.5 to 25   years. However, actual life of the components   of a parcel tanker or barge may be different   depending on many factors such as quality of   maintenance and repair and the type of product   carried by the ship or barge and this may result   in a shorter or longer life. </p>
<p> • Residual values are difficult to estimate   given the long lives of ships and barges, the   uncertainty as to future economic conditions   and the future price of steel, which is considered   as the main determinant of the residual price.   The Group currently estimates residual value   annually based upon the average steel price   for the last three years and the estimated light   displacement tonnage of the fleet. </p>
<p> If the estimated economic useful life is incorrect,   or circumstances change such that the estimated   economic useful life has to be revised, an   impairment loss or additional depreciation   expense could result in future periods. </p>
<p> A decrease in the useful life of the ship or barge   or fall in the residual value would have the effect   of increasing the annual depreciation charge and   potentially resulting in an impairment loss. </p>
<p> If the residual value is over estimated, it would   reduce the annual depreciation and overstate   the value of the assets. </p>
<p> See Note 15 for further details.  </p>
<p> Description   Judgements and Uncertainties  Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions <h2> Impairment of Ships  </h2>
 The Tanker fleet is reviewed for impairment   whenever events or changes in circumstances   indicate the carrying amount of the fleet may   not be recoverable.  </p>
<p> Management measures the recoverability of an   asset by comparing its carrying amount to the   higher of its fair value less costs to sale or future   discounted cash flows that the asset is expected   to generate over its remaining useful life. If an   asset is considered to be impaired, impairment   is recognised in an amount equal to the excess   of the carrying value of the asset over its   recoverable value. </p>
<p> The Tanker ships are tested for impairment   on a fleet basis as that is the lowest level in   which the cash flows are independent of other   cash-generating units. </p>
<p> The carrying values of the ships in the Tanker   fleet may not represent their fair market value   at any point in time since the market prices of   second-hand ships tend to fluctuate with changes   in freight rates and the cost of newbuildings.   Both charter rates and newbuilding costs tend   to be cyclical in nature. </p>
<p> In order to assess impairment, estimates and   assumptions regarding expected cash flows are   made which require considerable judgement and   are based upon existing contracts, historical   experience, discount rates, financial forecasts   and industry trends and conditions. </p>
<p> If actual results are not consistent with the   estimates and assumptions used in estimating   future cash flows and asset fair values while   evaluating impairment, then the Group may be   exposed to future losses that could be material. </p>
<p> Impairment tests have been carried out in 2010.   A projected 5% decrease in the deep sea tanker   trading gross margins assumed in the discounted   cash flow models used in the impairment testing   would result in a decrease in the present value   of the deep sea fleet of ships by approximately   $153.8 million. The result is still higher than net   book value and would not result in an impairment   of the ships. </p>
<p> An increase of 2% in the weighted average cost   of capital used in the present value calculation   would result in the decrease in present value   of the deep sea fleet of ships by approximately   $240.1 million which would not result in an   impairment of the ships. </p>
<p> Description   Judgements and Uncertainties  Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions <h2> Investments in Joint Ventures and Associates </h2>
 The consolidated financial statements include the   Group’s accounts and all other entities in which   the Group has a controlling financial interest,   except where the control over the operations   is limited by significant participating interests   held by another investor in such operations. </p>
<p> Where the Group does not have control, either   because of significant participating interests   by other parties or presence of only significant   influence or where there is joint control over   an entity, the entity is accounted for using the   equity method. </p>
<p> Controlling financial interest in an entity is   evaluated first by considering whether the entity   is a special purpose entity (“SPE”), a joint venture   or an associate under IFRS. </p>
<p> There are a number of areas where significant   judgement is exercised to establish whether an   entity needs to be consolidated or reported under   the equity method of accounting. In order to   establish whether an entity is a consolidated   subsidiary, a joint venture or an associate, key   areas of judgement include: </p>
<p> • Qualitative analysis of an entity including   review of, among other factors, its capital   structure, contractual terms, which interests   create or absorb variability, related party   relationships and design of the entity. </p>
<p> • Rights of partners regarding significant   business decisions, including disposals   and acquisitions of assets. </p>
<p> • Board and management representation. </p>
<p> • Ability to make financing decisions. </p>
<p> • Operating and capital budget approvals   and contractual rights of other parties. </p>
<p> The exercise of judgement on these areas   determines whether a particular entity is   consolidated or accounted for under the    equity method. </p>
<p> If the judgement applied in determining the   accounting treatment of an entity is incorrect   or the fact pattern on which it is based changes,   such entities may need to be consolidated or   result in unexpected losses being reflected on   the consolidated financial statements. </p>
<p> For example, it is possible that an investment   is accounted for as a joint venture or associate   using the equity method despite having an   ownership interest exceeding 50 percent where   it does not exercise direct or indirect control   over the investee. To the extent that the Group   is deemed to control these entities, the entities   would have to be consolidated. This would affect   the balance sheet, income statement, statement   of cash flows and debt covenants. </p>
<p> See Note 16 for further details. </p>
<p><h2> 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) </h2>
 <b>Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements </b>  <b>(continued)</b> </p>
<p> Description   Judgements and Uncertainties  Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions <h2> Biological Assets </h2>
 All mature turbot weighing more than 300 grams   and mature sturgeon weighing more than 3 kilos   are held at fair value less costs to sell and costs   related to packaging. Gains and losses from   changes in fair value are recognised in the   income statement. Fair value is based upon   observed prices for harvested fish, reduced   for harvesting costs and freight costs.  </p>
<p> Determination of fair value requires significant   judgement which includes the: </p>
<p> • Market price at the balance sheet date which   is often volatile and cyclical. </p>
<p> • Volume of biomass. </p>
<p> • Volume of mature biomass. </p>
<p> • Average weight of mature biomass. </p>
<p> • Estimated current mortality. </p>
<p> • Future mortality during harvesting and quality   of the fish. </p>
<p> For Sturgeon, the gender of the fish and the   quantity of the caviar produced is also uncertain. </p>
<p> The Group’s net earnings can fluctuate due to the   fair value adjustments on the biological assets at   each balance sheet date. </p>
<p> A small change in assumption, such as price, can   have a significant change on the valuation. For   example, based upon November 30, 2010 turbot   volumes, a change in the price of $1 per kilo   would have an impact on the turbot valuation    of $2.5 million. </p>
<p> See Note 13 for further details. </p>
<p> Description   Judgements and Uncertainties  Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions <h2> Goodwill Impairment Testing </h2>
 Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual   basis based upon the cash-generating unit for   which the goodwill is assigned. The Group’s   goodwill relates to the Tank Container segment.  </p>
<p> The impairment test involves determining the   recoverable amount of the Tank Container segment.   The recoverable amount is based upon the higher   of the segment’s value in use or the segment’s   fair value less costs to sell. The Tank Container   segment used the latter method and estimated   the fair value by multiplying the segment’s   2010 estimated earnings before depreciation,   amortisation, interest and taxes (“EBITDA”) by   a multiple. The result of this calculation was   $268 million higher than the net assets of   the segment. </p>
<p> The EBITDA was chosen in estimating fair   value for the impairment testing based upon   historical experience.  </p>
<p> Significant judgement is required to   determine the recoverable amount of the   Tank Container segment. </p>
<p> Judgement is required for the determination    of the multiple and its impact on the estimated   fair value. </p>
<p> If the judgement applied in determining the   recoverable amount of goodwill is incorrect or   the fact pattern on which it is based changes,   this could result in unexpected losses being   reflected in the consolidated financial statements. </p>
<p> Based upon the 2010 EBITDA, the multiplier   would have had to be reduced by approximately   50% in order for the segment’s recoverable value   to equal its carrying amount. </p>
<p> See Note 17 for further details related   to goodwill. </p>
<p> Description   Judgements and Uncertainties  Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions <h2> Pensions and Other Post-retirement Benefits </h2>
 The Group sponsors defined benefit pension    plans and a supplemental executive retirement   plan covering eligible employees. Net periodic   pension costs and accumulated benefit obligations   are determined in accordance with IAS 19,   “Employee Benefits,” using a number of   assumptions including the discount rate, the rate   of compensation increases, retirement ages,   mortality rates and expected long-term return on   plan assets. These assumptions have a significant   impact on the amounts reported. The Group’s   pension cost consists of service costs, interest   costs, amortisation of prior service costs or   benefits, expected returns on plan assets and,    in part, on a market-related valuation of assets.  </p>
<p> We also provide post-retirement benefits to   eligible retired employees and their spouses.    The post-retirement programme provides limited   health care benefits. This plan is not funded. </p>
<p> Management considers a number of factors in   developing the pension assumptions, including    an evaluation of relevant discount rates, expected   long-term returns on plan assets, plan asset   allocations, mortality, expected changes in wages   and retirement benefits, analyses of current   market conditions and input from actuaries   and other consultants. </p>
<p> Costs of the programmes are based on actuarially   determined amounts and are accrued over the   period from the date of hire to the full eligibility   date of employees who are expected to qualify   for these benefits. </p>
<p> A 0.25% point increase (decrease) in the discount   rate assumption would result in a decrease   (increase) in net periodic service cost component   of $0.2 million. </p>
<p> A 0.25% point increase (decrease) in the discount   rate assumption for the defined benefit obligation   would result in a decrease of $7.0 million   and an increase of $7.4 million in the defined   benefit obligation. </p>
<p> The effect of a 1% change in the assumed   healthcare cost trends on the accumulated   post-retirement benefit obligation at the end    of 2010 would be an approximate $1.5 million   increase or an approximate $1.3 million decrease   and the effect on the aggregate of the service   cost and interest cost of the net periodic    benefit cost for 2010 would be an approximate   $0.1 million increase or decrease. </p>
<p> If more than one of these assumptions were   changed simultaneously, the cumulative impact   would not necessarily be the same as if only   one assumption were changed in isolation. </p>
<p> See Note 23 for further details. </p>
<p>   </p>
<p><h2> 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) </h2>
 The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these   consolidated financial statements are given below. The accounting policies   listed below have been updated for standards which became effective during   the current year. These include:  </p>
<p> • IFRS 3 (revised), Business Combinations;  </p>
<p> • IAS 27 (revised), Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements; and  </p>
<p> • IFRS 7 (Amendment), Improving Disclosures about Financial   Instruments (“IFRS 7”).  </p>
<p> Other than additional disclosures for IFRS 7, there has been no impact    on the assets and liabilities recognised in these accounts for the above   standards. All other standards and amendments which became effective    in 2010 have had no impact on the Group. </p>
<p> <b>Basis of measurement</b>  The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost   basis except for derivative financial instruments and biological assets, all   of which are stated at their fair value. Non-current assets and disposal   groups held for sale are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount   and fair value less costs to sell. </p>
<p> Management believes that the Group’s cash flow from operations and   available credit facilities will continue to provide the cash necessary to   satisfy the Group’s working capital requirements and capital expenditures,   as well as to make scheduled debt repayments, remain in compliance with   the Group’s financial covenants and satisfy the Group’s other financial   commitments. The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern   basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements. </p>
<p> <b>Basis of consolidation</b>  (i) Subsidiaries  Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the   Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and   operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.   In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or   convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries   are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that   control commences until the date that control ceases. Where necessary,   adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring   the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. All   intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated   in full on consolidation. </p>
<p> (ii) Associates  Associates are those entities over which the Group is in a position to   exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control of the   financial and operating policies. The consolidated financial statements   include the Group’s share of the total comprehensive income of associates   based on the equity method of accounting, from the date that significant   influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.   Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as   adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of   the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. </p>
<p> When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the   Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses   is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal   or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an associate. </p>

Table 1:T a b l e   9 2 4 :   F i n a n c e   e x p e n s e                           ( 7 2 , 5 5 7 )  
|  Finance income           |                                 |     |     |    47,735  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  Profit from continuing   |  operations before income tax   |     |     |   133,251  |
|  Income tax expense       |                                 |     |     |  (20,493)  |
|  Loss from discontinued   |                    operations   |     |     |   (6,681)  |

<p> As the Group acts as the principal in the arrangement, all revenue relating   to the Joint Service is recognised on a gross basis in the income statement.   Certain ships that are not owned by the Group are time chartered under   operating leases by the Group from participants in the Joint Service.  </p>
<p> The time charter expense is calculated based upon the combined operating   revenue of the ships which participate in the Joint Service less combined   voyage expenses, overhead costs, and commissions to outside brokers and   upon each ship’s cargo capacity, its number of operating days during the   period, and its assigned earnings factor. </p>
<p> (ii) Tank Containers   Revenue from logistics services using tank containers is recognised based on   the stage of completion of such services at the period end date, recognising   the greater significance of specific acts in the successful completion of the   contract obligation. Revenue from services such as demurrage and other   ancillary services is recognised upon completion. </p>
<p> (iii) Terminals   Revenue for terminal operations primarily consists of rental income for   the utilisation of storage tanks by customers and other ancillary terminal   services provided, with the majority of rental income earned under annual   contracts. These contracts generally provide for fixed rates for the use of   the storage tanks and/or the throughput of products through the terminal   facility. Revenue is also earned under short-term agreements contracted   at spot rates. Revenue is recognised over the time period of usage or as   services are provided. </p>
<p> (iv) SSF  SSF recognises revenue based on the terms of sale. Where the terms of   sale are free on board, revenue is recognised on dispatch of products to   customers. Revenue is recognised on delivery of products to customers,   where the terms of sale are cost, insurance and freight and delivered   duty paid. The amount recorded as revenue includes all amounts invoiced   according to the terms of sale, including shipping and handling costs billed   to customers, and after deductions for claims or returns of goods, rebates   and allowances against the price of goods. </p>
<p> (v) Finance Income  Finance income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using   the effective interest method. </p>
<p> <b>Expenses</b>  (i) Operating expenses  Tankers:   Tankers operating expenses include costs directly associated with   the operation and maintenance of the parcel tankers. These types of costs   include time charter costs, bunker fuel costs, port costs, manning costs   (for example, ship personnel and benefits), depreciation expense, sublet   costs, repairs and maintenance of tankers, commission expenses, barging   and transshipments costs, canal transit costs, insurance premiums and other   ship owning expenses (for example, agency fees, provisions, ship supplies,   cleaning, cargo survey costs and foreign exchange hedging costs). </p>
<p> Tank Containers:   Operating expenses of tank containers consist of costs   directly associated with the operation and maintenance of the tank   containers. These types of costs include ocean and inland freight charges,   short-term tank rental expenses, cleaning and survey costs, additional costs   (services purchased and charged through to customers), maintenance and   repair costs, storage costs, insurance premiums, depreciation expense and   other operating expenses (for example, depot expenses, agency fees and   refurbishing costs). </p>
<p> Terminals:   Operating expenses of terminals consist of costs directly   associated with the operation and maintenance of the terminals. These   types of costs include labour and benefit costs, depreciation expense,   utilities, rail car hire expenses, real estate taxes for sites, maintenance   and repair costs, regulatory expenses, disposal costs, storage costs and   other operating expenses (for example, insurance, survey costs, cleaning,   line haul, rail costs and tank car hire costs). </p>
<p> SSF:   SSF operating expenses include production cost of goods sold   (“PCOGS”), which are costs incurred for the production of juvenile fish and   the subsequent growing of juvenile fish into adult fish ready for market.   These PCOGS include costs to produce eggs for fertilization, on-site labour/  personnel costs, feed costs, energy costs, contract grower fees, repairs and   maintenance costs, oxygen costs, and veterinary fees. Other costs included   within operating expenses are costs of fish purchased from third parties,   freight costs to customers, all primary and secondary processing and   packaging costs, distribution and handling costs, storage, import duties,   inventory write downs, lower of cost or market provisions, mortality losses   and fair value movements. </p>
<p> (ii) Leases   Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income   statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease   incentives received and receivable are recognised in the income statement   on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an integral part of the total   lease expense.  </p>
<p> (iii) Finance expenses  Finance expenses are recognised in the income statement as they accrue,   using the effective interest method. </p>
<p> For finance leases, lease payments are apportioned between the finance   charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is   allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant   periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.  </p>
<p> <b>Taxation</b>  Income tax represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. Income tax   is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to   items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. </p>
<p> Current tax is the sum of tax payable in respect of the taxable profit for the   current year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.   Taxable income differs from profit as reported in the income statement   because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible   in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s   liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted   or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. </p>
<p> Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary   differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for   financial reporting purposes and the corresponding amounts used in the   calculation of taxable income. The following temporary differences are not   provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill for which no tax deduction   is available; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither   accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and   differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures if it   is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable   future and the Group can control the reversal. The amount of deferred tax   provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of   the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or   substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. </p>
<p> The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet   date and recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient   future taxable income will be available to allow the asset to be utilised.  </p>
<p> Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable   right to set off current tax assets against current liabilities and when they   relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group   intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. </p>
<p> <b>Cash and cash equivalents</b>  Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits, which   are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. </p>
<p> <b>Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable</b>  Accounts receivable and accounts payable are initially valued at their fair   value and subsequently at amortised cost. Accounts receivable are subject   to value adjustments where their recovery is compromised. These value   adjustments are not continued if the reasons for which the value adjustments   were made have ceased to apply. </p>
<p> <b>Property, plant and equipment</b>  (i) Recognition and measurement  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated   depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. </p>
<p> Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition   of the asset. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of   significant assets are added to the cost of such assets until they are ready   for their intended use.  </p>
<p> Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards   of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases. Where land   and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of the land   is considered separately from that of the buildings. </p>
<p><h2> 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) </h2>
 Leased assets acquired by way of finance leasing are stated at an amount   equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum   lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and   impairment losses. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included as   a finance lease obligation. </p>
<p> (ii) Depreciation  Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis   over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant   and equipment. Land and assets under construction are not depreciated.   Property, plant and equipment are depreciated to a residual value which   reflects management’s estimate of scrap value or otherwise recoverable   value at the end of the estimated useful life of the asset. Residual values   and economic lives are reviewed annually. </p>
<p> Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful   lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of   the relevant lease.  </p>
<p> The estimated useful lives are as follows: </p>
<p> <b>Years</b>  <b>Tankers</b>  Parcel tankers and barges  20 to 25 </p>
<p> <b>Terminals</b>  Terminal tanks and structures  5 to 40  Other support equipment and other assets  3 to 45  Buildings  15 to 40 </p>
<p> <b>Stolt Tank Containers</b>  Tank containers  10 to 20  Buildings  40 to 50  Other operating equipment  3 to 10 </p>
<p> <b>SSF</b>  Transportation equipment  5 to 10  Operating equipment and other assets  5 to 14  Buildings  15 to 33 </p>
<p> (iii) Subsequent costs – drydocking costs  Generally, ships drydock every five years. After a ship is fifteen years old   a shipping society classification intermediate survey is performed between   the second and third year of the five-year drydocking period. The Group   capitalises a substantial portion of the costs incurred during drydocking,   including the survey costs and depreciates those costs on a straight-line   basis from the time of completion of a drydocking or intermediate survey   based upon the estimated life of each component of the drydocking. The   Group expenses costs related to routine repairs and maintenance incurred   during drydocking that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the   ships. If the drydock results in an extension of the life of a ship, then the   estimated useful life of the ship is changed accordingly. </p>
<p> (iv) Disposals  The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is   determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying   amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement. </p>
<p> <b>Goodwill and intangible assets </b>  Goodwill represents amounts arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries,   associates and jointly controlled entities. Goodwill arising on acquisition   represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair   value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Identifiable intangible assets   are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights   regardless of whether those rights are separable. </p>
<p> Goodwill is initially recognised at cost and is subsequently measured   at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated   to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually   for impairment, or more frequently when there is an indication that the   cash-generating unit is impaired. With respect to associates and jointly   controlled entities, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the   carrying amount of the investment in the associate or joint venture. </p>
<p> Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised in the income   statement in the period in which the acquisition is completed. </p>
<p> Other finite life intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated   at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation   for finite-lived intangibles is charged to the income statement under   Operating Expenses on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives   of the intangible assets. The trademark intangible is being amortised over   a 10-year life while the customer relations intangible is amortised over 5   years and computer software is amortised over an average life of 3 to 5 years. </p>
<p> <b>Impairment of tangible and intangible assets </b>  The carrying amounts of the Group’s tangible and intangible assets are   reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any   indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable   amount is estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment   loss. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent   from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the   cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with   an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever   there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. Ship newbuildings   and other assets under construction are tested for impairment when there   is an indication of impairment.  </p>
<p> The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and   value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are   discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects   current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific   to the asset.  </p>
<p> An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset   or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment   losses are recognised in the income statement. </p>
<p> An impairment loss, other than for goodwill, is reversed when there is an   indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been   a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. </p>
<p> <b>Inventories other than biological assets</b>  Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.   The cost of inventories is based on the first-in, first-out principle and   includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing   them to their existing location and condition.  </p>
<p> Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course   of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. </p>
<p> The cost of items transferred from biological assets to inventory is the fair   value less costs to sell at the date of harvest. </p>
<p> <b>Biological assets</b>  Biological assets comprise primarily turbot and sturgeon, which include   fish with and without an active market for sale (‘mature’ and ‘juvenile’ fish),   which are farmed by the Group.  </p>
<p> (i) Turbot  Turbot is considered as ‘mature’ when it weighs more than 300 grams while   juvenile turbot weighs less than 300 grams. All mature turbot are held   at fair value less costs to sell and costs related to packaging. Gains and   losses from changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement.   Fair value is determined on the basis of market prices. </p>
<p> Juvenile turbot are carried at cost less provision for impairment as   management do not believe that reliable fair values exist. This approach   is used to measure juvenile turbot for the following reasons: </p>
<p> • There is no active market for juvenile turbot. </p>
<p> • A non-active market price based upon discounted cash flows requires a   number of variables and assumptions which historically cannot be reliably   determined. Key variables and assumptions for turbot include mortality   rate, time to maturity, rate of growth and market price at the point   of harvest. Given the specific circumstances for juvenile assets, any   assumptions would be highly subjective.  </p>
<p> • The extent of these uncertainties also results in difficulty in determining   the appropriate discount rate. </p>
<p> A fair value adjustment is made at the point when previously juvenile turbot   is considered to mature, which typically occurs when the fish reaches the   specified weight of 300 grams. These fair value adjustments are recognised   in the income statement.  </p>
<p> After harvest, the produce from harvest is treated as inventory and the   fair value at the point of harvest is treated as the cost of the inventory. </p>
<p> (ii) Sturgeon  Sturgeon are ‘mature’ when they reach 3 kilos per fish. The fair value   of mature sturgeon is estimated at the higher of cost less provision for   impairment or market value less costs to sell and costs related to packaging   estimated based on the meat price of sturgeon and its weight. </p>
<p> Sturgeon and caviar that the sturgeon produces are fair valued at the point   of harvest. After harvest, the caviar produced from harvest is treated as   inventory and the fair value at the point of harvest is treated as the cost   of the inventory. </p>
<p> There is no active market for juvenile sturgeon. They are therefore carried   at cost less provision for impairment for the same reasons as those stated   above for the juvenile turbot. </p>
<p> <b>Interest-bearing borrowings</b>  Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less   directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition,   interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference   between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income   statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis. </p>
<p> (i) Defined contribution plans  Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are   recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred. </p>
<p> (ii) Defined benefit plans and other post-employment benefits  The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans and   other post-employment benefits is calculated separately for each plan by   estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in   return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is   discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan   assets (at bid price) is deducted.  </p>
<p> The liability discount rate for each plan is based on the yield curve   of a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that have maturity   dates approximating to the terms of the respective plan’s obligations.   The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected   unit credit method. </p>
<p> When the benefits of a plan are increased, the portion of the increased   benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense in   the income statement on a straight-line basis over the average period until   the benefits become vested. To the extent that the benefits vest immediately,   the expense is recognised immediately in the income statement. </p>
<p> All actuarial gains and losses as at December 1, 2006, the date of transition   to IFRS, were recognised. In respect of actuarial gains and losses that arise   subsequent to this date, the Group recognises them directly in equity in the   period in which they occur through the statement of comprehensive income.  </p>
<p> Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised   is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or   reductions in future contributions to the plan. </p>
<p> (iii) Short-term and long-term cash-based benefits  Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted   basis while long-term cash-based employee benefit obligations are   discounted based on expected payment date. They are expensed in the   period in which the related service is provided. An accrual is recognised   for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or   profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive   obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by   the employees and the obligation can be estimated reliably. </p>
<p><h2> 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) </h2>
 (iv) Share-based payments   The fair value at the grant date of options granted to employees is   recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity   over the vesting period. The fair value of the options granted is measured   using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model, taking into account   the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount   recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share   options that vest. </p>
<p> <b>Provisions</b>  A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a   present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it   is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle   the obligation. Provisions are measured at management’s best estimate of   the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date   and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. </p>
<p> <b>Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations</b>  Non-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale   if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale   transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded   as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group   is available for immediate sale in its present condition. The sale should be   expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from   the date of classification. </p>
<p> On initial classification as held for sale and in subsequent reporting periods,   non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous   carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken   to the income statement.  </p>
<p> A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that   represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of   operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale,   that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or that meets the criteria   to be classified as held for sale. </p>
<p> Discontinued operations are presented on the income statement (including   the comparative period) in a single line which comprises the post-tax   profit or loss of the discontinued operation and the post-tax gain or loss   recognised on the re-measurement to fair value less costs to sell or on   disposal of the assets/disposal groups constituting discontinued operations. </p>
<p> <b>Foreign currency</b>  (i) Foreign currency transactions  The individual financial statements of all Group companies are presented in   the functional currency of the primary economic environment in which the   subsidiaries and equity method investees operate. </p>
<p> Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange   rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities   denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated   at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at that date. Non-monetary assets and   liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency   are not retranslated while non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in   foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign   exchange rates prevailing at the dates the fair value was determined.  </p>
<p> Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the   income statement, except for those differences arising from hedging and   monetary balances with foreign operations where settlement is not planned   and unlikely to occur. Differences related to hedging of operating expenses   are also recorded in operating expenses. </p>
<p> (ii) Foreign operations  For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets   and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations, including goodwill and   fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated at foreign   exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. The revenues and   expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the   period where this rate approximates the foreign exchange rates at the   dates of the transactions. </p>
<p> Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations   subsequent to December 1, 2006 (the date of adoption of IFRS), and of   related qualifying hedges are taken directly to the foreign currency reserve.   Cumulative translation adjustments before that date were recognised in   equity. Such translation differences are recognised in the income statement   upon disposal of the foreign operation. </p>
<p> <b>Derivative financial instruments and hedging</b>  The Group enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency   transactions, interest rate swaps to hedge the risk of variability of interest   payments and bunker fuel hedge contracts to lock in the price for a portion   of forecasted bunker fuel requirements. No instruments are held for   speculative purposes. </p>
<p> Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the   date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured   to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss on   remeasurement is recognised immediately in the income statement unless   the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which   event the timing of the recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on   the nature of the item being hedged. The impact in the income statement is   shown in interest, foreign currency exchange gain or operating expenses as   appropriate, based on the underlying of the derivative. </p>
<p> (i) Determination of fair value  The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the   Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date,   taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness   of the swap counterparties. The fair value of forward exchange contracts   is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date. Bunker fuel hedge   contracts are valued based upon independent broker valuations. </p>
<p> (ii) Cash flow hedges  Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the   variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable   forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative   financial instrument is recognised directly in equity. Any ineffective portion   of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement. </p>
<p> When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of   a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the associated cumulative   gain or loss remains in equity and is reclassified into profit or loss in the   same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed   affects profit or loss, i.e. when a non-financial asset is depreciated. </p>
<p> If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition   of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains and losses   that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified into the income   statement in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired   or liability assumed affects profit or loss, i.e. when finance income or   expense is recognised. </p>
<p> When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or   the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged   forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss   at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the   above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is   no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss   recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately. </p>
<p> (iii) Embedded Derivatives  Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts   are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are   not closely related to the host contract. Contracts are assessed for embedded   derivatives at inception of such contracts or when the Group becomes party   to them. Embedded derivatives that have been separated from host contracts   are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date. Any gains or losses   arising from changes in fair value are directly taken to the income statement. </p>
<p> <b>Equity capital stock</b>  The company’s capital comprises equity capital stock. Equity capital stock   is measured based upon net proceeds.  </p>
<p> <b>Dividends</b>  Dividends recommended by the Board of Directors are recognised in the   financial statements when they have been approved by the shareholders   at the Annual General Meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when   approved by the Board of Directors. </p>
<p> <b>Earnings per Common Share</b>  Basic Earnings per Common Share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net   income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the   year. Diluted EPS is computed by adjusting the weighted average number   of shares outstanding during the year for all potentially dilutive shares and   equivalents outstanding during the year using the Treasury stock method.  </p>
<p> As further discussed in Note 26, “Capital Stock, Founder’s Shares and   Dividends Declared”, Founder’s shares, which provide the holder thereof   with certain control features, only participate in earnings to the extent   of $0.005 per share for the years in which dividends are declared, and are   limited to $0.05 per share upon liquidation. For the purposes of computing   EPS, dividends paid on Founder’s shares are deducted from earnings to arrive   at net profit attributable to Common shareholders. Founder’s shares are not   included in the basic or diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the   computation of earnings per Common share. </p>
<p> The outstanding share options under the 1997 Share Option Plan are   included in the diluted EPS calculation to the extent they are dilutive. </p>
<p> <b>Business combinations</b>  Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase accounting   method. This involves recognising identifiable assets (including previously   unrecognised intangible assets) and liabilities (including contingent liabilities   and excluding future restructuring) of the acquired business at fair value. The   cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the   date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity   instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.   The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are   recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. Any non-controlling   interest in the acquiree is initially measured at the interest’s proportion of the   net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.   Acquisitions from non-controlling interests are considered transactions with   shareholders and decreases or increases between the cost and the net value   are recorded directly in shareholders’ equity.  </p>
<p> The merger by absorption and amalgamation of Stolt-Nielsen S.A. into and   with Stolt-Nielsen Limited is a business combination under common control.   Common control business combinations are accounted for using predecessor   accounting. Assets and liabilities of the combined companies are recognised   at their book values for the entire accounting period during which the   combination took place and for the comparative period. Results and   cashflows are also presented for the current and comparative period as   if the two companies had always been combined. </p>
<p> <b>IFRSs issued but not effective as of November 30, 2010</b>  The following new or amendments to standards and interpretations have   been issued and become effective in 2011 and beyond but will have no   material impact on the financial statements of the Group: </p>

<p><h2> 3. Business and Geographic Segment Information </h2>
 The Group has four principal operating and reportable segments, which are Tankers, Tank Containers, Terminals and Sea Farm. The nature of these segments   is described in Note 1. These operating segments were determined based on the nature of the products and services offered. Operating segments are defined   as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker in   deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Group’s Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision   maker. The Group’s chief operating decision maker directs the allocation of resources to operating segments based on the operating profit (loss) and cash   flows of each respective segment. </p>
<p> The Stolt-Nielsen Gas segment had previously been shown as a reportable segment. However, as discussed further in Note 33, this segment is being shown   as a discontinued operation as its operating subsidiary, Avance Gas Holding, Ltd. (“AGHL”), was contributed to a newly created joint venture in the post   balance sheet period. </p>
<p> The “Corporate and Other” category includes corporate-related items and the results of other insignificant operations not reportable under other segments. </p>
<p> The basis of measurement and accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 2. Inter-segment sales and transfers   are not significant and have been eliminated and not included in the following table. Indirect costs and assets have been apportioned between the   segments of the Group on the basis of corresponding direct costs and assets. Interest and income taxes are not allocated.  </p>
<p> The following tables show the summarised financial information, in U.S. thousands dollars, for each reportable segment and the underlying operating segments: </p>

<p><h2> 3. Business and Geographic Segment Information (continued) </h2>
 The following table sets out operating revenue by country for the reportable segments. Tankers, Tank Containers and Terminals operating revenue is allocated   on the basis of the country in which the cargo is loaded. Tankers and Tank Containers operate in a significant number of countries.

<p> On June 16, 2008, the Group entered into two joint ventures with Gulf Navigation PJSC (“Gulf Navigation”). The first joint venture, Gulf Stolt Tankers   DMCCO (“Gulf Stolt Tankers”), purchased four new 44,000 dwt coated chemical tankers from the Group for $192.1 million in 2010. The ships are being   traded in the Joint Service. Technical ship management is being provided by a second joint venture, Gulf Stolt Ship Management JLT. Upon the sale, the   Group recognised a gain of $1.7 million (see Note 7) and deferred $1.7 million which will be amortised over the life of the ships. </p>
<p> On March 16, 2009 Gulf Stolt Tankers entered into a $134.8 million secured term loan agreement with Deutsche Bank AG, Nordea Bank Norge ASA and Fokus   Bank. The facility was intended to finance up to 70% of the total purchase price of three of the 44,000 dwt parcel tankers which were under construction at   SLS at the time. The facility, which is fully guaranteed by the joint venture and non-recourse to the Group, matures on May 31, 2016. On September 1, 2009   the banks agreed to extend the availability of the tranche related to the first ship until November 30, 2009 in exchange for an increase in the margin. On   January 12, 2010, the facility was expanded to include all four of the 44,000 dwt parcel tankers ordered from SLS. At the same time the availability period   was extended to encompass new delivery dates. The interest rate for the facility is based on Libor plus a margin. </p>

<p><h2> 19. Short-Term Bank Loans and Lines of Credit </h2>
 Short-term bank loans, which amounted to $145.0 million and $355.9 million as of November 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, consist principally of   drawdowns under committed and uncommitted lines of credit and overdraft facilities. </p>
<p> Amounts borrowed pursuant to these facilities bear interest at rates ranging from 1.1% to 1.3% in 2010, and from 1.1% to 6.0% in 2009. The weighted   average interest rate was 1.2% and 1.5% for the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. </p>
<p> As of November 30, 2010, the Group had various credit lines, including committed lines totalling $597.4 million of which $452.4 million was undrawn   and available for future use. Of the total $623.2 million credit lines at November 30, 2010, $597.4 million is committed beyond one year from the balance   sheet date and is secured and $25.8 million is periodically subject to renewal. The $25.8 million unsecured credit lines are payable on demand and can   be withdrawn by the banks at short notice. Commitment fees for unused lines of credit were $1.3 million and $0.7 million for the years ended November 30,   2010 and 2009, respectively.  </p>
<p> Several of the short-term and long-term credit facilities contain various financial covenants applicable either quarterly or annually, which, if not complied   with, could result in the acceleration of repayment of amounts due and could limit the ability of the Group to draw funds from time to time. During the   years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009, the Group was in compliance with the financial covenants under its debt agreements.  </p>
<p> Agreements executed in connection with certain debt obligations require that the Group maintains defined financial covenants, including but not limited   to, minimum consolidated tangible net worth of $600 million, maximum consolidated debt to tangible net worth of not greater than two to one and   minimum EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of not less than two to one. Most of the debt agreements provide for a cross default in the event of   a default in another agreement. In the event of a default that extends beyond the applicable remedy or cure period, lenders may accelerate repayment   of amounts due to them. Substantially all of the debt is collateralised by mortgages on ships and terminals with a net carrying value of $1.4 billion and   $1.5 billion as of November 30, 2010 and November 30, 2009, respectively. </p>
<p><h2> 20. Long-Term Debt and Finance Leases </h2>

<p><h2> 20. Long-Term Debt and Finance Leases (continued) </h2>
 <b>Long-term debt</b>  Long-term debt is denominated primarily in U.S. dollars, with nil and $0.2 million denominated in other currencies as of November 30, 2010 and   2009, respectively.  </p>
<p> (i) Preferred ship fixed rate and variable rate mortgages  On March 9, 2009 the Group entered into a $250.0 million facility agreement with Eksportfinans ASA and DnB Nor Bank ASA to be secured by mortgages on   four ships that the Group had contracted to be constructed by STX Norway AS, Florø (“STX Yards”) in Norway. $200.0 million of this facility is guaranteed by   Garanti-instituttet for Eksportkredit ASA. As of November 30, 2010 the Group had drawn down a total of $250.0 million under the facility as all ships have   been delivered. Delivery of the M/T   Stolt Groenland   was in December 2009 and the M/T   Stolt Breland   was in March 2010. On the delivery of each of the ships,   the loan portion in respect of each of the ships (referred in the loan agreement as tranches 1-4) was drawn and will be repaid in 24 semi-annual installments,   with balloon payments along with the 24th installment for tranches 1-4 totalling $37.5 million. The Group has converted the LIBOR rate into a fixed rate   loan through interest rate swap contracts based on the anticipated future delivery dates. The swaps began to be effective on December 1, 2009.  </p>
<p> On February 8, 2008, the Group accepted an offer made by Danish Ship Finance A/S for a $150.0 million top-off facility to be secured by eight currently   owned ships. This $150.0 million top-off facility was added to an existing facility with Danish Ship Finance A/S. On this new top-off facility the Group   drew down $100.0 million in 2008 and $14.0 million in 2009 with the final drawdown of $36.0 million made in December 2009. Each tranche has a   maturity of 10 years after the draw down date. </p>
<p> On February 15, 2008, the Group entered into a NOK 825.6 million facility agreement with Eksportfinans and DnB Nor Bank ASA and drew down the 12-year   secured term loan in 2008 for $146.3 million. Upon draw down, the loan was converted into a fixed U.S. dollar liability. The loan is secured by a mortgage   on the first two ships delivered from STX Yards in Norway. </p>
<p> (ii) Senior secured credit facility  The Group has a $200 million seven-year secured term loan and revolving credit agreement with various lending institutions including DnB Nor Bank ASA   as administrative and collateral agent. The initial draw down on this facility was $169.0 million with an additional $20.7 million drawn down in 2008   and $4.7 million in 2009. The interest rates on this facility are based on LIBOR plus a margin. The LIBOR rate has been converted to a fixed rate for   $159.0 million of the total loan through interest rate swap contracts. </p>
<p> (iii) Variable rate construction debt  On August 21, 2008, the Group entered into a $625.0 million loan facility guaranteed by the Korean Export Insurance Corporation for the financing of   eight newbuildings to be constructed by SLS. The facility allowed for pre-delivery draw downs secured by the refund guarantee, and was to be secured by   mortgages on the ships once these were delivered. In 2009 and 2008, respectively, the Group had drawn down $44.7 million and $118.3 million under the   facility to finance progress payments made to the yard. As discussed in Note 8, the SLS ship contracts were cancelled when it became obvious that the yard   would not be able to deliver the ships on schedule. Upon receipt of the refund, the Group fully repaid the outstanding loan facility of $164.7 million.  </p>
<p> (iv) Debt issuance costs  Debt issuance costs of $4.5 million and $18.8 million have been netted against long-term debt at November 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Debt issuance   costs recognised as part of effective interest rates were $2.1 million and $2.4 million for the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. </p>

<p><h2> 21. Operating Leases  </h2>
 As of November 30, 2010, the Group was obligated to make payments under long-term operating lease agreements for tankers, a Very Large Gas Container   (“VLGC”), terminal facilities, tank containers, barges, land, equipment and offices. Certain of the leases contain clauses requiring payments in excess of the   base amounts to cover operating expenses related to the leased assets.  </p>
<p> During 2002 to 2006 the Group entered into agreements with various Japanese shipowners for the time charter (operating lease) of six parcel tankers with   initial periods of 36 to 96 months which include an option for the Group to extend the agreements for up to nine additional years. In addition, the Group   also has the option to purchase each ship at predetermined prices at any time after three years from the delivery of the ship. These operating leases had   commitments for the initial periods of approximately $70.0 million, as of November 30, 2010, for the period 2011 through 2016 and are included in the   schedule below. The Group acquired two of the parcel tankers in 2010. </p>
<p> In November 2009, a subsidiary of AGHL entered into a time charter for the VLGC   Yuhsho   for three years. See Note 33 for further discussion of AGHL.   The operating lease had commitments for the initial period of approximately $16.6 million and is included in the schedule below.  </p>
<p> Minimum annual lease commitments, under agreements which expire at various dates through 2028 are as follows: </p>
<p> <b>2010</b>  2009  (in thousands)  2011  <b>$</b>  <b>183,374 </b>  $  138,486  2012   <b>147,617</b>  98,375  2013   <b>76,201 </b>  71,237  2014   <b>22,803 </b>  16,090  2015   <b>15,499 </b>  10,914  Thereafter   <b>50,880 </b>  14,496 </p>

<p> Rental and charter hire expenses under operating lease agreements for the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009 were $195.4 million and $191.8 million,   respectively, net of sub-lease income of $6.9 million and nil, respectively. Of the total lease expense, no material amounts were from sub-leases.  </p>
<p> In addition to the above operating leases, through the Joint Service, certain ships are time chartered under operating leases from participants   in the Joint Service. For the two years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009, charter hire expenses related to these leases were $64.8 million and   $52.3 million, respectively.  </p>
<p> Future minimum sublease payments expected to be received by the Group under non-cancellable subleases at November 30, 2010 and 2009 were   $36.8 million and nil, respectively, on two ships time chartered from Joint Service Participants.  </p>

<p> During 2007 whilst in the process of renewing the operating licence of the terminal in Santos, the local environmental pollution authority required that   the Group conduct a routine environmental assessment of the terminal land. The assessment uncovered certain potential environmental concerns.   Additional investigation has been performed and $0.7 million is the Group’s best estimate of the future remediation provision at November 30, 2010. </p>
<p> The restructuring provision included severance costs from the partial restructure of Stolt Tank Containers in Europe subsequent to the acquisition of the   Taby Group and severance costs related to the outsourcing of certain business technology positions. The restructuring plan is expected to be completed   in 2011.  </p>
<p><h2> 23. Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefit Plans  </h2>
 Certain of the subsidiaries of the Group have pension and other post-retirement benefit plans covering substantially all of their shore-based employees   and certain ship officers of the Group. The Group’s policy is to fund pension and other post-retirement costs as required by applicable laws and regulations.  </p>

<p> U.S.-based employees retiring from the Group after attaining the age of 55 with at least 10 years of service with the Group are eligible to receive    post-retirement health care coverage for themselves and their eligible dependants. These benefits are subject to deductibles, co-payment provisions,   and other limitations. The Group reserves the right to change or terminate the benefits at any time. </p>
<p> The following tables set forth the change in benefit obligations for the Group’s defined benefit pension plans and U.S. other post-retirement plans and   the change in plan assets for the defined benefit pension plans. There are no plan assets associated with the U.S. other post-retirement plans. </p>

<p> Actual gain on plan assets was $18.2 million and $20.5 million for the years ended November 30, 2010 and November 30, 2009, respectively. </p>
<p> The amounts recognised at November 30, consisted of the following: </p>
<p> As of November 30,   <b>2010</b>  2009  (in thousands)  Non current asset   <b>$</b>  <b>13,378 </b>  $  14,507  Non current liabilities   <b>(50,047) </b>  (59,881)  Net prepaid/(accrued) benefit/(cost)  <b>$</b>  <b>(36,669)</b>  $  (45,374) </p>
<p> The following are the assumptions used in the measurement of the projected benefit obligation and net periodic pension expense for pension benefits, and   the accumulated projected benefit obligation and retiree medical expense for U.S. other post-retirement benefits: </p>
<p> As of November 30,   <b>2010</b>  2009  (in thousands)  <b>Weighted-Average Assumptions </b>  Discount rate   <b>5.68% </b>  7.06%  Expected long-term rate of return on assets   <b>6.68% </b>  6.93%  Rate of increase in compensation levels   <b>3.89% </b>  3.82%  Rate of inflation   <b>2.92% </b>  2.82%  Life expectancy for an individual currently at 65:   Male   <b>19.3 yrs </b>  19.2 yrs  Female   <b>21.6 yrs </b>  21.3 yrs </p>
<p> Health care cost trends assume an 8.6% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for 2010, reducing gradually each   year, reaching an ultimate rate of 4.5% in 2029 and remaining at that level thereafter. The effect of a 1% change in these assumed cost trends on the   accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation at the end of 2010 would be an approximate $1.5 million increase or an approximate $1.3 million decrease   and the effect on the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost of the net periodic benefit cost for 2010 would be an approximate $0.1 million   increase or decrease. </p>
<p> The Group’s defined benefit pension plans’ weighted-average asset allocation as of November 30, 2010 and 2009, by category, was as follows: </p>

<p> Management reviews the expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis and revises them as appropriate.  </p>
<p> The Group expects to contribute $13.3 million to its defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans in 2011.  </p>
<p> The history of experience (gains) losses and cumulative actuarial losses(gains) recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income   (before tax) is as follows: </p>

<p> The Group also provides defined contribution plans to certain of its qualifying employees. Group contributions charged to expense for these plans were   $8.8 million and $7.6 million for the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  </p>
<p><h2> 24. Commitments and Contingencies </h2>
 As of November 30, 2010 and 2009, the Group had total capital expenditure purchase commitments outstanding of approximately $608.0 million and   $746.0 million, respectively. At November 30, 2010 the total purchase commitments consisted of committed amounts on five second-hand ships, the   construction of a terminal on Jurong Island in Singapore, approximately 1,000 tank containers, four bitumen ships, five barges and other smaller projects   in the businesses. The Group had a committed term sheet in place for $200.0 million for financing the terminal on Jurong Island as of November 30, 2010. </p>
<p> <b>Shipbuilding Contracts</b>  The Group entered into six shipbuilding contracts with Kleven Florø in 2006 (since then acquired by STX and now referred above as STX Yards) to build   six 43,000 dwt parcel tankers. The last four ships were to be constructed pursuant to the Common Structural Rules (“CSR”) for tankers issued by the   International Association of Classification Societies although the precise impact of this was still to be resolved at the time the contracts were agreed.   STX Yards has claimed an additional total cost of $12.3 million for the above four ships for complying with the CSR requirements and permissible delay   varying from 35 to 90 days for each ship. The Group disputed this claim as it considered the yard claim to be excessive and that STX Yards was entitled   to $4.8 million.  </p>
<p> On October 22, 2010, the Group and STX Yards agreed to settle the dispute. Under the shipbuilding agreements, the Group paid the disputed amounts   in order to take delivery of each ship. As a result of this settlement, STX Yards returned $7.5 million of the disputed amount to the Group. An additional   $0.2 million was paid in interest on the refund. </p>
<p> The Group entered into an agreement with SLS for four 44,000 dwt parcel tankers in 2005. In January 2010, due to extended delays, an agreement   was reached with SLS to purchase the ships at a reduced price. The last of the four ships was delivered in July 2010. These ships have been sold into   Gulf Stolt Tankers.  </p>
<p> See Note 8 for discussion of the SLS shipbuilding contracts and refund of previously paid progress payments. </p>
<p> In May and July 2010, NYK Stolt Shipholding Inc, the Group’s 50% owned joint venture with Nippon Yusen Kaisha, took delivery of the first two of four   12,800 dwt stainless steel chemical carriers on order at Usuki Shipyard Co Ltd (“Usuki”) in Japan. Delivery of the final two ships are expected in 2011.   The Group has provided guarantees to Usuki for 50% of the cost of the ships. At November 30, 2010, the guarantee is for the Group’s share of expenditures   of $37.4 million and extends until June 2011. The Group has recorded a liability of $0.1 million at November 30, 2010 in relation to the fair value of this   guarantee. The joint venture has committed financing and sufficient cash to meet all the remaining yard payments. </p>
<p> <b>Purchase Commitments</b>  The Group’s joint ventures had an additional $38.4 million of purchase commitments, not specifically guaranteed by the Group. These primarily relate   to terminal capital projects. </p>
<p> <b>Environmental</b>  The Group’s operations involve the carriage, use, storage and disposal of chemicals and other hazardous materials and wastes. The Group is subject   to applicable international and national health, safety and environmental laws relating to the protection of the environment, including those   governing discharges of pollutants to air and water, the generation, management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and the cleanup   of contaminated sites. </p>
<p> The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), commonly known as Superfund, was enacted by the U.S.   Congress on December 11, 1980. This law created a tax on the chemical and petroleum industries and provided broad Federal authority to respond directly   to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that may endanger public health or the environment. This law and similar state environment   statutes and common laws can impose liability for the entire cleanup of contaminated sites or for third-party claims for property damage and personal   injury, regardless of whether the current owner or operator owned or operated the site at the time of the release of contaminants or the legality of the   original disposal activities. </p>
<p> During 2001, the Group sold their tank storage terminals in Perth Amboy, New Jersey and Chicago, Illinois. Under the terms of the sales agreements, the   Group had retained responsibility for certain environmental contingencies, should they arise during the covered period which ended two years after the   closing dates, in connection with these two sites. As of November 30, 2010, the Group has not been notified of any such contingencies having been incurred   by the purchaser of the two sites and neither does it anticipate any such contingencies being incurred in the future. The Chicago, Illinois terminal property   had been leased under a long-term agreement with the Illinois International Port District. In addition, as part of the Chicago, Illinois sale, the Group   assigned its rights to the terminal property to a third party. The Group is contingently liable if the third party does not return the facility in acceptable   condition at the end of the sublease period, on June 30, 2026. Due to the uncertainties over the resolution of this matter, no provision has been recorded. </p>
<p> The Group retained ownership of approximately 77 acres of land at Perth Amboy with potentially contaminated property. In a bankruptcy proceeding   involving a previous owner of the property, the bankruptcy court approved a remediation fund designated for and to be held in escrow for such cleanup   costs, which funds have been paid from the court and are being held in escrow. As the Group does not feel it is probable that any future cash outflows   will be greater than the amount held in escrow, no liability has been recorded. </p>
<p> The Group’s tank storage terminal in Braithwaite, Louisiana (“Stolthaven New Orleans”) received various compliance orders and notices of potential penalty   in July and August 2008 from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (“LDEQ”) relating to a discharge of product in March 2008. Stolthaven New   Orleans has contested certain findings of the LDEQ. These enforcement notices raise potential violations of Louisiana environmental laws and regulations.   As a result of the same discharge of product, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a request for information in June 2008 requesting   documents and information. The United States Department of Justice also issued a subpoena for documents in July 2008 relating to the same incident.   Stolthaven New Orleans has cooperated with each of the requests from such governmental agencies. Due to the uncertainties over the resolution of this   matter, only a small provision has been recorded. </p>
<p><h2> 25. Legal Proceedings  </h2>
 For the matters described below, the Company incurred legal costs and provisions of $0.4 million in 2010 and $7.4 million in 2009, which are included in   “Administrative and general expenses” in the consolidated income statements. The Group records provisions for certain legal cases discussed below where   it believes the likelihood of losses is probable. Ongoing legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s consolidated financial   position or results of operations in the future.  </p>
<p> The Company expects that it will continue to incur additional legal costs until these matters are resolved. During 2010, the Company was involved in   certain antitrust-related legal proceedings. </p>
<p> <b>Governmental Antitrust Investigations into the Company’s Parcel Tanker Business</b>  In 2002, the Company became aware of information that caused it to undertake an internal investigation regarding potential improper collusive behaviour   in its parcel tanker and intra-Europe inland barge operations. As a consequence of the internal investigation, the Company voluntarily reported certain   conduct to the Antitrust Division (the “Antitrust Division”) of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the Competition Directorate of the European   Commission (the “EC”). The DOJ and the EC investigations ultimately were concluded without any fines or penalties being imposed against the Company. </p>
<p> On September 30, 2008, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement to resolve a related investigation by the Canadian Competition   Bureau (“CCB”) into the parcel tanker shipping industry. The Company was not charged with an offence and did not admit to any violations of Canadian   competition law. At that time, the Company consented to the issuance of a Prohibition Order by the Federal Court of Canada requiring certain ongoing   compliance measures with Canadian competition laws and made a payment of Canadian $200,000 dollars toward the cost of the CCB investigation.  </p>
<p> The CCB investigation is ongoing, and the Company is continuing to cooperate with the CCB. The Company is unable to determine if an unfavourable   outcome is probable, is unable to estimate a range of possible losses, and has therefore made no provisions for any fines related to the ongoing Canadian   antitrust investigation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. It is possible that the outcome of this ongoing investigation could result   in criminal prosecutions, and if the Company is found guilty, material fines and penalties. Consequently, the outcome of the CCB investigation could have   a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. </p>
<p> <b>Antitrust Civil Class Action Litigations and Arbitrations</b>  During 2010, there were two putative private antitrust class action lawsuits outstanding against the Company in U.S. federal and state courts for alleged   violations of antitrust laws:  </p>
<p> 1. 	   Karen Brock, on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, v. Stolt-Nielsen S.A., Stolt-Nielsen Transportation Group Ltd., Odfjell ASA, Odfjell USA,   Inc., Jo Tankers BV, Jo Tankers USA, Inc., Tokyo Marine Co. Ltd and Does 1 through 100 inclusive, No. CGC 04429758 (Superior Court of Cal., County of   San Francisco) (“Brock”); and </p>
<p> 2. 	   AnimalFeeds International Corp., Inversiones Pesqueras S.A., Central Pacific Protein Corp, and Atlantic Shippers of Texas, Inc., individually and on behalf of   all other similarly situated v. Stolt-Nielsen S.A., Stolt-Nielsen Transportation Group Ltd., Odfjell ASA; Odfjell USA Inc., Jo Tankers BV, Jo Tankers USA, Inc.,   and Tokyo Marine Co. Ltd, 2:03-CV-5002 (E.D. Pa.) (“AnimalFeeds”). </p>
<p> These class actions set forth almost identical claims of collusion and bid rigging in the parcel tanker industry. On behalf of each putative class, the suits   seek treble damages in unspecified amounts and allege violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act or various state antitrust and unfair trade practices acts.  </p>
<p> In the   Brock   class action, parties claiming to be indirect purchasers of the Company’s parcel tanker services brought claims in California state court   antitrust class actions, alleging that collusion resulted in higher prices being passed on to them. The   Brock   action, which is currently pending, was stayed   through late 2010. On January 12, 2011, the Company, along with the other defendants, moved to dismiss the   Brock   complaint in its entirety for failing   to state a claim and because the plaintiffs lack standing. </p>
<p> In   AnimalFeeds  , a customer claimed on behalf of a putative class that, as a result of the defendants’ alleged collusive conduct, it paid higher prices under   its contracts with the defendants.   AnimalFeeds   was first consolidated into a single multidistrict litigation proceeding in the U.S. District Court for the   District of Connecticut. As a result of other proceedings,   AnimalFeeds  , a direct purchaser, was required to proceed in arbitration rather than in federal   district court. A New York arbitration panel then ruled that   Animalfeeds   could proceed with its claims on a class action basis. The Company challenged   that arbitration panel ruling in federal court. </p>
<p> On April 27, 2010, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the Company’s favour, rejecting class arbitration of antitrust claims brought by a   purported class led by   AnimalFeeds  . The Court’s majority opinion held an arbitration panel’s earlier decision that had permitted class arbitration was in   conflict with the principle that arbitration is a matter of consent. </p>
<p> In October 2010, plaintiff-claimant   Animalfeeds   voluntarily dismissed all of its remaining claims against the Company, pursuant to a settlement agreement,   terminating the   Animalfeeds   litigation and arbitration. The   Animalfeeds   settlement was not a material event for the Company. </p>
<p> <b>Customer Settlements</b>  Since the governmental antitrust investigations began, the Company has engaged in discussions with a number of customers regarding the subject matter   of those investigations to resolve existing and potential antitrust claims by such customers. The Company has typically resolved such claims by amending the   commercial terms of its agreements with its customers and, in some case, making up-front cash payments or guaranteed payments to customers. In 2010,   the Company has made no provisions against operating revenue for any settlement agreements or agreements in principle or offers made to customers. </p>
<p> <b>Federal Securities Class Action Litigation</b>  The Company and four individuals are defendants in a putative civil securities class action claim filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of   Connecticut. The complaint alleges that the Company and the other defendants violated U.S. embargo laws, as well as U.S. securities laws, because the   Company’s public filings failed to disclose that a “material portion” of its revenues resulted from the defendants’ violations of U.S. embargo and antitrust   laws. In June 2009, the Company finalised a settlement agreement that resolves this litigation. This agreement admits no liability or wrongdoing on the   part of the Company or its officers and Directors and requires the Company to make payments totalling $2.0 million. The agreement requires, among other   things, notice to the class of the proposed terms, and is subject to court approval, which cannot be assured and remains pending. The Company has made   a $2.0 million accrual in 2009 with respect to this settlement agreement. </p>
<p> On September 10, 2010, the Court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement between the parties, as required by law. The Court’s preliminary approval   means that the parties can implement the settlement procedures called for in the settlement agreement and under applicable law, subject to final approval   from the Court. The Court held a hearing on January 25, 2011, at which time it granted final approval of the proposed settlement.  </p>
<p> <b>General</b>  The Company is a party to various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that none of those matters   will have a material adverse effect on its business or financial condition. </p>
<p> The Company was also involved in arbitration related to certain shipbuilding contracts. These are discussed above in Note 24. </p>
<p> The ultimate outcome of governmental and third-party legal proceedings is inherently difficult to predict. The Company’s operations are affected by   U.S. and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations. Compliance with such laws and regulations entails considerable expense, including   ship modifications and changes in operating procedure. </p>
<p> Due to the uncertainty over the resolution of the matters described above, as of November 30, 2010, the Company had not established any reserves   for legal fees and costs related to these proceedings. </p>

<p> See Note 28 for additional information on the exercise of share options. </p>
<p> <b>Merger of Stolt-Nielsen S.A. with Stolt-Nielsen Limited</b>  On November 16, 2010, the shareholders of each of Stolt-Nielsen Limited and Stolt-Nielsen S.A. approved a merger by absorption and amalgamation of   Stolt-Nielsen S.A. into and with Stolt-Nielsen Limited, and the amalgamated company has continued as an exempted company under the laws of Bermuda.   As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Stolt-Nielsen S.A. and Stolt-Nielsen Limited have become the assets and liabilities of the merged company,   Stolt-Nielsen Limited, upon the Merger becoming effective on November 18, 2010 in accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act by way of amalgamation,   and as a merger under the Luxembourg Company Law.  </p>
<p> Upon the completion of the merger, one Common Share in Stolt-Nielsen S.A. was converted into and became one Common Share in SNL, and one Founder’s   Share in Stolt-Nielsen S.A. became one Founder’s Share in SNL. Share capital is being presented as if Stolt-Nielsen Limited had always been in existence.   The Common shares of SNL are listed in Norway on the Oslo Børs. </p>
<p><h2> 26. Capital Stock, Founder’s Shares and Dividends Declared (continued) </h2>
 <b>Share Rights</b>  The Group’s authorised share capital consists of 65,000,000 Common shares, par value $1.00 per share, and 16,250,000 Founder’s shares, par value $0.001   per share. Except for matters where applicable law requires the approval of both classes of shares voting as separate classes, Common shares and Founder’s   shares vote as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders, with each share entitled to one vote. </p>
<p> Under the Bye-laws, holders of Common shares and Founder’s shares participate in annual dividends, if any are declared by the Group, in the following order   of priority: (i) $0.005 per share to Founder’s shares and Common shares equally; and (ii) thereafter, all further amounts are payable to Common shares only.  </p>
<p> Furthermore, the Bye-laws also set forth the priorities to be applied to each of the Common shares and Founder’s shares in the event of a liquidation. Under   the Bye-laws, in the event of a liquidation, all debts and obligations of the Group must first be paid and thereafter all remaining assets of the Group are   paid to the holders of Common shares and Founder’s shares in the following order of priority: (i) Common shares ratably to the extent of the par value   thereof ($1.00 per share); (ii) Common shares and Founder’s shares participate equally up to $0.05 per share; and (iii) thereafter, Common shares are   entitled to all remaining assets. </p>
<p> <b>Dividends</b>  For November 2010, the Group’s Board of Directors declared an interim dividend of $0.50 per Common share and $0.005 per Founder’s share on November 19,   2010 to shareholders of record as of December 2, 2010. The total gross amount of the dividend was $29.9 million, which was classified as an interim dividend. </p>
<p> In November 2009, the Group’s Board of Directors declared an interim dividend of $0.50 per Common share and $0.005 per Founder’s share which was paid   on December 9, 2009 to all shareholders of record as of November 25, 2009. The dividend resulted in a cash payment to holders of Common shares and   Founder shares of $29.9 million. The Board of Directors of Stolt-Nielsen S.A. decided not to recommend a final dividend payment for 2009, which reflected   the company’s emphasis on conserving cash, pending evidence of a recovery in its key markets. </p>
<p> On February 13, 2009, the Group’s Board of Directors recommended no final 2008 dividend payment for 2008. The action reflected the Group’s focus on   conserving cash, given the weakness and uncertainty in the global economic outlook. </p>
<p> <b>Founder’s Shares and Treasury Shares</b>  As of November 30, 2010 and 2009, 14,914,828 and 14,912,447, respectively, of Founder’s shares had been issued to Fiducia Ltd, net of Treasury shares.   Additional Founder’s shares are issuable to holders of outstanding Founder’s shares without consideration, in quantities sufficient to maintain a ratio   of Common shares to Founder’s shares of 4 to 1. In November 2010, the Founder paid $16,033 for the Founder’s shares. </p>
<p> As of November 30, 2010 and 2009, 4,474,487 and 4,484,008, respectively, of Treasury shares were held by the Group. The Group also held 1,118,621   and 1,121,002 of Founder’s shares.  </p>
<p> <b>Share Repurchase</b>  The Group announced on November 19, 2010, that the Board of Directors has authorised the Company to purchase up to $50 million worth of its Common   shares. The total number of shares repurchased under this programme in 2010 was 42,800 for $0.2 million. The Company also acquired 10,700 Founder’s shares. </p>
<p> <b>Capital Management</b>  The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for   shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust   the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, repurchase   shares or sell assets to reduce debt. </p>
<p> The Group monitors capital on the basis of debt to tangible net worth. This is calculated as short-term and long-term debt divided by Shareholders’ equity   less intangible assets. As of November 30, 2010 and 2009, the ratio of debt to shareholders’ equity less intangible assets was as follows: </p>
<p> November 30,  <b>2010</b>     2009  (in thousands)  Short-term bank loans and long-term debt   <b>$</b>  <b>992,614 </b>  $  1,280,407  Shareholders’ equity less intangible assets   <b>1,499,683 </b>  1,481,012 </p>
<p> <b>Debt to Tangible Net Worth </b>  <b>0.66 </b>  0.86 </p>
<p><h2> 27. Restrictions on Payment of Dividends </h2>
 Under Bermuda law, dividends cannot be paid if there are reasonable grounds for believing that:  </p>
<p> (a)	 The company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or </p>
<p> (b)	The realisable value of the company’s assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share   premium accounts. </p>
<p><h2> 28. Share-Based Compensation </h2>
 The Group has a 1997 Share Option Plan (the “1997 Plan”) covering 5,180,000 Common shares. No further grants will be issued under the 1997 Plan as   it expired in 2007 although options granted prior thereto continue to be exercisable in accordance with their stated terms. Such option grants have been   replaced with a cash-settled non-equity based performance incentive plan. The 1997 Plan is administered by a Compensation Committee appointed by   the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee awarded options based on the grantee’s position in the Group, degree of responsibility, seniority,   contribution to the Group and such other factors as it deemed relevant under the circumstances.  </p>
<p> Share options were issued at the current market price of SNL shares on the date of the grant. The grant date was the date on which the Compensation   Committee approved the grant.  </p>
<p> All Class B shares issued in connection with the exercise of options will immediately convert to Common shares upon issuance. Options granted under the   plan vest 25% on the first anniversary of the grant date, with an additional 25% vesting on each subsequent anniversary of continued employment. Options   may be exercisable for periods of up to 10 years at an exercise price not less than the fair market value per share at the grant date. Options are forfeited   by employees upon termination of employment in most circumstances.  </p>
<p> Share-based expense for the year ended November 30, 2010 and 2009 was $0.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively. </p>

<p> All of the Group’s derivative activities are financial instruments not traded on a stock exchange and entered into with major financial institutions for   hedging the Group’s committed exposures or firm commitments with major financial credit institutions, shipbuilders and ship repair yards. The Group   holds foreign exchange forward contracts, commodity contracts and interest rate swaps, which subject the Group to a minimum level of counter-party risk.   The Group does not believe that it has a material exposure to credit risk from third parties failing to perform according to the terms of hedge instruments.  </p>
<p> The net loss recognised in equity for interest rate derivatives was $7.7 million, for foreign currency derivatives was $8.7 million and for bunker derivatives   was $2.2 million for the year ended November 30, 2010. For the year ended November 30, 2009, there was a net loss of $1.4 million for interest rate   derivatives while there was a net gain of $21.5 million for foreign currency derivatives and $60.4 million for bunker derivatives. At November 30, 2010,   a deferred income tax loss on the interest rate derivatives of $0.8 million was included in equity and at November 30, 2009, $6.9 million deferred income   tax gain was included.  </p>
<p> <b>Foreign Currency</b>  The following foreign exchange contracts, maturing through October 11, 2011, were outstanding as of November 30, 2010 and 2009: </p>
<p> Purchase </p>
<p> <b>2010</b>  2009  (in local currency, thousands)  Norwegian Kroner  <b> 57,544</b>  108,000  Euro  <b> 13,438</b>  23,000  Singapore Dollar  <b> 31,410</b>  36,000  Chinese Renminbi  <b> 26,000 </b>  56,000  British Sterling  <b> 8,100 </b>  11,400 </p>
<p> The U.S. dollar equivalent of the currencies which the Group had contracted to purchase was $66.2 million and $99.2 million as of November 30, 2010   and 2009, respectively. </p>
<p> The Group utilises foreign currency derivatives to hedge committed and forecasted cash flow exposures. Substantially all of these contracts have been   designated as cash flow hedges.  </p>
<p> The Group has elected non-hedge accounting treatment for the remaining contracts, which are immaterial. Gains and losses on hedges of committed   commercial transactions are recorded as a foreign exchange gain or loss. </p>
<p> For the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009, a $3.1 million net unrealised gain and $0.9 million loss, respectively, were reclassified from the hedging   reserve into earnings. In 2011, $0.8 million of net unrealised gain included in hedging reserve is expected to be reclassified in earnings. </p>
<p> <b>Bunker Purchases Contracts</b>  The Group entered into futures contracts to hedge a portion of its future bunker purchases for nil and $4.8 million as of November 30, 2010 and 2009,   respectively. These derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges. For the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009, $1.8 million gain and   $46.2 million loss, respectively, were recognised in Operating expense. </p>
<p> <b>Interest Rate Swaps</b>  The Group entered into interest rate swaps with notional values of $396.7 million and $407.9 million as of November 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.   These derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges. For the years ended November 30, 2010 and 2009, $12.1 million and $7.4 million,   respectively, were recognised in finance expense. The balance is expected to be reclassified to earnings in 2011 to 2021. </p>
<p> Of the total, nothing was reclassified into earnings for the ineffective portion of the derivative instruments for the years ended November 30, 2010   and 2009. </p>
<p><h2> 31. Financial Instruments and Risk Factors </h2>
 <b>Financial Risk Factors</b>  The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for   shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The Group’s activities   expose it to a variety of financial risks such as market risk (including currency risk, cash flow interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity   risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects   on the Group’s financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.  </p>
<p> Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Group treasury identifies, evaluates and   hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as   written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment   of excess liquidity. </p>
<p> <b>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</b>  The following estimated fair value amounts of financial instruments have been determined by the Group, using appropriate market information and valuation   methodologies. Considerable judgement is required to develop these estimates of fair value, thus the estimates provided herein are not necessarily indicative   of the amounts that could be realised in a current market exchange: </p>

<p> The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses dividend payable and short-term bank loans are a   reasonable estimate of their fair value, due to the short maturity thereof. The estimated value of the Group’s long-term debt is based on interest rates as   of November 30, 2010 and 2009, using debt instruments of similar risk and maturities. The fair values of the Group’s foreign exchange and bunker contracts   are based on their estimated market values as of November 30, 2010 and 2009.  </p>
<p> Market value of interest rate swaps was estimated based on the amount the Group would receive or pay to terminate its agreements as of November 30,   2010 and 2009.  </p>
<p> The Group has no financial assets which would otherwise have been past due or impaired that have been renegotiated. </p>

<p> <b>Concentration of Credit Risk</b>  Trade receivables are from customers across all lines of the Group’s business. The Group extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business.   The maximum exposure to credit risk is the Accounts Receivable balance of $175.9 million. The Group regularly reviews its accounts receivable by performing   credit checks upon entering into an initial sales contract with a customer and by the respective business controllers regularly reviewing the days past due   accounts receivable reports. The majority of trade receivables are in U.S. dollars. </p>
<p> An analysis of the age of trade receivables that are past due is as follows: </p>

<p><h2> 31. Financial Instruments and Risk Factors (continued) </h2>
 The allowance for doubtful accounts changed as follows: </p>
<p>    <b>2010</b>     2009  (in thousands)  Balance at the beginning of the year  <b>$</b>  <b>12,428</b>   13,410   Charged against revenue   <b>3,787 </b>  2,888  Accounts written off   <b>(3,135)</b>  (3,575)  Other   <b>– </b>  (295)  Balance at the end of the year  <b>$</b>  <b>13,080</b>  $   12,428  </p>
<p> The amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid balances, information about the current financial condition of customers, and other relevant   information. Management does not believe significant risk exists in connection with concentrations of credit as of November 30, 2010. </p>
<p> <b>Market Risk</b>  The Group is exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and bunker fuel costs. To manage the volatility relating   to these exposures, the Group enters into derivative transactions in accordance with Group policies. The financial impact of these instruments is offset by   corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. Derivative instruments are not held for trading or speculative purposes. </p>
<p> The Group uses a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the market risk of the derivative financial instruments. The model utilises a variance/covariance   modelling technique. VAR models are intended to measure the maximum potential loss for an instrument or portfolio, assuming adverse changes in market   conditions for a specific time period and confidence level. As of November 30, 2010, the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value of foreign   exchange rate instruments, calculated using the VAR model given a 95% confidence level, would be $0.8 million from adverse changes in foreign exchange   rates. The maximum potential one-day loss in fair value for adverse changes in interest rate and bunker fuel prices, given a 95% confidence level, would   be $35 thousand. Actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time, and it is highly unlikely that losses such as these   would be experienced over an extended period of time. These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, since actual results may differ   significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets. </p>
<p> The fair value losses shown in the table below have no impact on the Group’s results or financial condition and serve only as an illustration of derivative   and short-term interest rate volatility. Note that any adverse movement in foreign exchange or bunker derivatives is offset by corresponding changes in   the fair value of the underlying exposure being hedged. </p>
<p> As of November 30,  VAR </p>
<p> <b>2010</b>     2009  (in millions)  Foreign currency exchange rates   <b>$</b>  <b>0.8 </b>  $  1.2   Interest rates   <b>* </b>  0.3   Bunker fuel rates   <b>– </b>  0.2  </p>
<p> * Less than $0.1 million. </p>
<p> The change in the VAR, in connection with foreign exchange rates, interest rates and bunker fuel rates, is attributable to market volatility.  </p>
<p> <b>Liquidity Risk</b>  Cash flow forecasting is performed by the operating entities of the Group and is aggregated at the corporate level. The Treasury department monitors rolling   forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure the Group has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its   undrawn committed borrowing facilities (see Note 19) at all times so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants on any of its borrowing   facilities. Such forecasting takes into consideration the Group’s debt financing plans, covenant compliance, compliance with internal balance sheet ratio   targets and certain currencies’ restrictions. </p>
<p> <b>Fair Value Estimation</b>  The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows: </p>
<p> • Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1). </p>
<p> • Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly   (that is, derived from prices) (level 2).  </p>
<p> • Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3). </p>

<p> The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active   if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices   represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis.  </p>
<p> The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation   techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific   estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. </p>
<p> If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. </p>
<p> Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include: </p>
<p> • Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments.  </p>
<p> • The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.  </p>
<p> • The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with the resulting   value discounted back to present value.  </p>

<p><h2> 33. Discontinued Operations and Held for Sale Assets and Liabilities </h2>
 On December 2, 2010, a subsidiary of Stolt-Nielsen Gas Limited, AGHL, acquired three VLGCs owned by Sungas Holdings Ltd (“Sungas”) for $211.4 million.   AGHL issued to Sungas common shares worth $56.7 million for a 50% ownership in AGHL and entered into shareholder loans with the Group and Sungas   for the remaining $154.7 million. An additional shareholder loan was made by each shareholder for $10.0 million on December 2, 2010 for working capital.   Subsequent to the acquisition, the Group is expected to receive approximately $3.7 million and Sungas to pay $1.0 million in additional consideration   for working capital contributed. This was funded by contributions of $1.4 million from each shareholder. </p>
<p> A shareholder agreement was entered into between Sungas and Stolt-Nielsen Gas Limited which provides that the future operations of AGHL will be jointly   controlled by the shareholders. As a result of the transaction, Stolt-Nielsen Limited has deconsolidated AGHL, effective December 2, 2010, and will account   for it using the equity method in the future. AGHL will continue to perform the Group’s operations in the transportation of LPG.  </p>
<p> The Group is showing the Stolt-Nielsen Gas segment as a discontinued operation and its assets as held for sale as of November 30, 2010 as it has disposed   of its controlling interest, though retaining an investment interest in the joint venture, in the post balance sheet period. </p>
<p> Upon disposal, Stolt-Nielsen Gas Limited is expected to recognise a gain of approximately $7.0 million as the difference between its share of AGHL and   the carrying amount of the assets contributed to AGHL. Stolt-Nielsen Gas Limited also received $7.5 million from Sungas as settlement for contractual   obligations entered into by each shareholder prior to entering into the shareholder agreement. </p>

 On December 2, 2010, AGHL acquired three VLGCs owned by Sungas. See Note 33 above for further details. </p>
<p> The Group took delivery of four ships subsequent to November 30, 2010 and entered into a commitment to acquire another ship. The total purchase price   of the five ships was $161.0 million. Deliveries are as follows: </p>
<p> • On December 6, 2010, the M/T   Golden Charlotte  , a Japanese built stainless steel parcel tanker (resold to a third party on the same day).  </p>

<p> All the ships will be entered into the Joint Service.  </p>
<p> The Group received $47.7 million upon the sale of the M/T   Stolt Nanami   in January 2011 and the M/T   Golden Charlotte  , which was resold to a third party   on the same day as it was delivered. </p>
<p> On February 17, 2011 the Group’s Board of Directors recommended a final dividend for 2010 of $0.50 per Common share, payable on May 12, 2011, to   shareholders of record as of April 28, 2011. </p>

<p><h2> Independent Auditors’ Report </h2>
</p>
<p> To the shareholders and Board of directors of Stolt-Nielsen Limited </p>
<p> <b>Report on the financial statements </b>  We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Stolt-Nielsen Limited which comprise the balance sheet as of 30 November 2010 and the income   statement, statement of other comprehensive income, statement of changes in shareholders’ equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended   and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes. </p>
<p> <b>Management’s responsibility for the financial statements</b>  Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting   Standards as adopted by the European Union and in accordance with applicable law in Bermuda. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and   maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether   due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.  </p>
<p> <b>Auditor’s responsibility</b>  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International   Standards on Auditing. Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance   whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.  </p>
<p> This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 90 of The Companies   Act 1981 (Bermuda) and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other   person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. </p>
<p> An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected   depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or   error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial   statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the   effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness   of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  </p>
<p> We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.  </p>
<p> <b>Opinion</b>  In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of 30 November 2010,   and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by   the European Union and in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1981 (Bermuda). </p>

<p> The Company is reimbursed by its subsidiaries for certain administrative and general expenses incurred on behalf of the subsidiaries.  </p>
<p> The Company also prepares consolidated financial statements, which are published according to the provision of the law. </p>
<p> In these financial statements, the use of the term “Company” is also used for the predecessor company, Stolt-Nielsen, S.A. </p>
<p><h2> 2.	 Summary of significant accounting policies </h2>
 The financial statements of Stolt-Nielsen Limited have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards   as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) and IFRIC Interpretations. </p>
<p> The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these financial statements are given below. </p>
<p> <b>Basis of measurement</b>  The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis.  </p>
<p> <b>Cash and cash equivalents</b>  Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. </p>
<p> <b>Debtors and creditors</b>  Debtors and creditors are initially valued at their fair value and subsequently at amortised cost. Debtors are subject to value adjustments where their   recovery is compromised. These value adjustments are not continued if the reasons for which the value adjustments were made have ceased to apply. </p>
<p> <b>Investments in subsidiaries</b>  The Company accounts for its investments in subsidiaries at historical cost. At each reporting date investments in subsidiaries are assessed for an   indication of impairment. As the investments in subsidiaries are not listed on a stock exchange or dealt in another regulated market, market value   corresponds to the probable market or recovery value estimated with care and in good faith by Management. At November 30, 2010, no indication   of impairment was discovered.  </p>
<p> Stolt-Nielsen Limited Annual Accounts </p>
<p> <b>Foreign currency transactions</b>  Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities   denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at that date. Non-monetary assets and   liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated while non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in   foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates prevailing at the dates the fair value was determined.  </p>

<p><h2> 7.	 Other creditors </h2>
 The balance of other creditors as at November 30, 2010 mainly relates to the 2010 interim dividend of $29.9 million. </p>
<p><h2> 8.	 Commitments and contingencies </h2>
 As of November 30, 2010, the Company has guaranteed substantially all of the $847.6 million in long-term debt obligations of its direct and   indirect subsidiaries.  </p>
<p> As of November 30, 2010, the Company’s subsidiaries and certain of its indirect subsidiaries had various credit lines payable through 2013 totalling   $623.2 million, of which $452.4 million of committed lines was undrawn and available for future use. Substantially all of the short-term bank loans   outstanding under these credit facilities at November 30, 2010 are guaranteed by the Company. Several of the credit facilities contain various financial   covenants, which, if not complied with, could limit the ability to draw funds from time to time.  </p>
<p> Substantially all debt is secured on assets owned by the Company’s subsidiaries; therefore, no liability has been recorded in relation to the fair value   of this guarantee.  </p>
<p> Subsidiaries of the Company have entered into contracts for the purchase of foreign currencies under their foreign exchange lines with various banks.   Any contracts entered into pursuant to these lines generally are guaranteed by the Company. Certain of the currency positions entered into by these   subsidiaries effectively have been closed by entering into offsetting foreign exchange contracts. At November 30, 2010, the total market value of the   currencies which these subsidiaries had contracted to purchase pursuant to open foreign exchange contracts maturing through November 2011 was   $66.2 million.  </p>
<p><h2> 9.	 Legal proceedings  </h2>
 The Group records provisions for certain legal cases discussed below where it believes the likelihood of losses is probable. Ongoing legal proceedings could   have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries’ consolidated financial positions or results of operations in the future. None of the   provisions have been booked in the Company accounts. </p>
<p> The Company expects that it will continue to incur additional legal costs until these matters are resolved. During 2010, the Company was involved in   certain antitrust-related legal proceedings. </p>
<p> <b>Governmental Antitrust Investigations into the Company’s Parcel Tanker Business</b>  In 2002, the Company became aware of information that caused it to undertake an internal investigation regarding potential improper collusive behaviour   in its parcel tanker and intra-Europe inland barge operations. As a consequence of the internal investigation, the Company voluntarily reported certain   conduct to the Antitrust Division (the “Antitrust Division”) of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the Competition Directorate of the European   Commission (the “EC”). The DOJ and the EC investigations ultimately were concluded without any fines or penalties being imposed against the Company. </p>
<p> On September 30, 2008, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement to resolve a related investigation by the Canadian Competition   Bureau (“CCB”) into the parcel tanker shipping industry. The Company was not charged with an offence and did not admit to any violations of Canadian   competition law. At that time, the Company consented to the issuance of a Prohibition Order by the Federal Court of Canada requiring certain ongoing   compliance measures with Canadian competition laws and made a payment of CDN $200,000 dollars toward the cost of the CCB investigation.  </p>
<p> The CCB investigation is ongoing, and the Company is continuing to cooperate with the CCB. The Company is unable to determine if an unfavourable   outcome is probable, is unable to estimate a range of possible losses, and has therefore made no provisions for any fines related to the ongoing Canadian   antitrust investigation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. It is possible that the outcome of this ongoing investigation could result   in criminal prosecutions, and if the Company is found guilty, material fines and penalties. Consequently, the outcome of the CCB investigation could have   a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. </p>
<p> <b>Antitrust Civil Class Action Litigations and Arbitrations</b>  During 2010, there were two putative private antitrust class action lawsuits outstanding against the Company in U.S. federal and state courts for alleged   violations of antitrust laws:  </p>
<p> 1.	   Karen Brock, on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, v. Stolt-Nielsen S.A., Stolt-Nielsen Transportation Group Ltd., Odfjell ASA, Odfjell USA,   Inc., Jo Tankers BV, Jo Tankers USA, Inc., Tokyo Marine Co. Ltd and Does 1 through 100 inclusive, No. CGC 04429758 (Superior Court of Cal., County    of San Francisco) (“Brock”); and </p>
<p> 2.	   AnimalFeeds International Corp., Inversiones Pesqueras S.A., Central Pacific Protein Corp, and Atlantic Shippers of Texas, Inc., individually and on behalf of   all other similarly situated v. Stolt-Nielsen S.A., Stolt-Nielsen Transportation Group Ltd., Odfjell ASA; Odfjell USA Inc., Jo Tankers BV, Jo Tankers USA, Inc.,   and Tokyo Marine Co. Ltd, 2:03-CV-5002 (E.D. Pa.) (“AnimalFeeds”). </p>
<p> These class actions set forth almost identical claims of collusion and bid rigging in the parcel tanker industry. On behalf of each putative class, the suits   seek treble damages in unspecified amounts and allege violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act or various state antitrust and unfair trade practices acts.  </p>
<p> <b>Stolt-Nielsen Limited  </b>  <b>Notes to the Financial Statements continued</b> </p>
<p><h2> 9.	 Legal proceedings (continued) </h2>
 In the   Brock   class action, parties claiming to be indirect purchasers of the Company’s parcel tanker services brought claims in California state court   antitrust class actions, alleging that collusion resulted in higher prices being passed on to them. The   Brock   action, which is currently pending, was stayed   through late 2010. On January 12, 2011, the Company, along with the other defendants, moved to dismiss the   Brock   complaint in its entirety for failing   to state a claim and because the plaintiffs lack standing. </p>
<p> In   AnimalFeeds  , a customer claimed on behalf of a putative class that, as a result of the defendants’ alleged collusive conduct, it paid higher prices under   its contracts with the defendants.   AnimalFeeds   was first consolidated into a single multidistrict litigation proceeding in the U.S. District Court for the   District of Connecticut. As a result of other proceedings,   AnimalFeeds  , a direct purchaser, was required to proceed in arbitration rather than in federal   district court. A New York arbitration panel then ruled that   Animalfeeds   could proceed with its claims on a class action basis. The Company challenged   that arbitration panel ruling in federal court. </p>
<p> On April 27, 2010, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the Company’s favour, rejecting class arbitration of antitrust claims brought by a   purported class led by   AnimalFeeds  . The Court’s majority opinion held an arbitration panel’s earlier decision that had permitted class arbitration was in   conflict with the principle that arbitration is a matter of consent. </p>
<p> In October 2010, plaintiff-claimant   Animalfeeds   voluntarily dismissed all of its remaining claims against the Company, pursuant to a settlement agreement,   terminating the   Animalfeeds   litigation and arbitration. The Animalfeeds settlement was not a material event for the Company. </p>
<p> <b>Customer Settlements</b>  Since the governmental antitrust investigations began, the Company has engaged in discussions with a number of customers regarding the subject matter   of those investigations to resolve existing and potential antitrust claims by such customers. The Company has typically resolved such claims by amending   the commercial terms of its agreements with its customers and, in some case, making up-front cash payments or guaranteed payments to customers. In 2010,   the Company has made no provisions against operating revenue for any settlement agreements or agreements in principle or offers made to customers.  </p>
<p> <b>Federal Securities Class Action Litigation</b>  The Company and four individuals are defendants in a putative civil securities class action claim filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of   Connecticut. The complaint alleges that the Company and the other defendants violated U.S. embargo laws, as well as U.S. securities laws, because the   Company’s public filings failed to disclose that a “material portion” of its revenues resulted from the defendants’ violations of U.S. embargo and antitrust   laws. In June 2009, the Company finalised a settlement agreement that resolves this litigation. This agreement admits no liability or wrongdoing on the   part of the Company or its officers and directors and requires the Company to make payments totalling $2.0 million. The agreement requires, among other   things, notice to the class of the proposed terms, and is subject to court approval, which cannot be assured and remains pending. The Company has made   a $2.0 million accrual with respect to this settlement agreement. </p>
<p> On September 10, 2010, the Court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement between the parties, as required by law. The Court’s preliminary approval   means that the parties can implement the settlement procedures called for in the settlement agreement and under applicable law, subject to final approval   from the Court. The Court held a hearing on January 25, 2011, at which time it granted final approval of the proposed settlement. </p>
<p> <b>General</b>  The Company is a party to various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that none of those matters   will have a material adverse effect on its business or financial condition. </p>
<p> The Company was also involved in arbitration related to certain shipbuilding contracts but these have been settled in the current year.  </p>
<p> The ultimate outcome of governmental and third-party legal proceedings is inherently difficult to predict. The Company’s operations are affected by   U.S. and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations. Compliance with such laws and regulations entails considerable expense, including   ship modifications and changes in operating procedure. </p>
<p> Due to the uncertainty over the resolution of the matters described above, as of November 30, 2010, the Company had not established any reserves   for legal fees and costs related to these proceedings. </p>

<p> Furthermore, the Bye-laws also set forth the priorities to be applied to each of the Common shares and Founder’s shares in the event of a liquidation. Under   the Bye-laws, in the event of a liquidation, all debts and obligations of the Company must first be paid and thereafter all remaining assets of the Company   are paid to the holders of Common shares and Founder’s shares in the following order of priority: (i) Common shares ratably to the extent of the par value   thereof ($1.00 per share); (ii) Common shares and Founder’s shares participate equally up to $0.05 per share; and (iii) thereafter, Common shares are   entitled to all remaining assets. </p>

The total amount of shares repurchased under this programme in 2010 was 42,800 for $0.2 million. The Company also acquired 10,700   Founder’s shares. </p>
<p> <b>Capital Management</b>  The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for   shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust   the capital structure, the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, repurchase   shares or sell assets to reduce debt. Capital management for the Company is performed on a consolidated basis with its subsidiaries. </p>

<h2> 	 Financial risk management </h2>
 The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company and its subsidiaries’ ability to continue as a going concern in order to   provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The Company   and its subsidiaries’ activities expose it to a variety of financial risks such as market risk (including currency risk, cash flow interest rate risk and price risk),   credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise   potential adverse effects on the Company and its subsidiaries’ financial performance.  </p>
<p> Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Company’s treasury identifies,   evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Company’s operating units. The Board provides written principles for overall risk   management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial   instruments and investment of excess liquidity. All risk management is performed for the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. </p>

<p> The assets and liabilities of Stolt-Nielsen S.A. have been brought into the balance sheet of the Company at historic values as adjusted for differences   between Luxembourg GAAP and IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The only significant GAAP difference relates to the recognition of share-based   payments issued by the Company to the employees of the subsidiaries. Under IFRS, the fair value of share options recorded for the Company’s subsidiaries’   employees is recognised in the Company’s balance sheet by recording a capital contribution in the Company’s investment in subsidiaries with a corresponding   credit to shareholders’ equity. At the date of the merger, the cumulative share-based charge under IFRS 2, Share-based Payments, was $20.1 million. As such,   an adjustment was recorded to increase the investment in subsidiaries and paid-in surplus for $20.1 million. </p>
