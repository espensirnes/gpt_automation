The increase in total operating revenue from $495,000 in 2009 to $25,940,000 in 2010, along with a positive EBITDA, indicates strong operational performance. However, the high operating expenses and substantial net loss of $20,988,000 highlight the need for improved cost management and financial planning. The company's high level of interest-bearing debt is a concern, potentially impacting future profitability and financial stability. Despite these challenges, the secured long-term contracts with major clients like Petrobras and Statoil provide revenue stability and enhance market positioning. The company's strong organizational structure, adherence to corporate governance, and excellent HSEQ performance further bolster its growth potential. However, careful financial management and diversification of the client base will be crucial for sustained success.
